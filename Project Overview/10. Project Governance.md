   - **Members**: List the members of the steering committee, typically including senior stakeholders and key decision-makers.

2. **Project Manager**:
   - **Role and Responsibilities**: Outline the role of the project manager in leading the project, including planning, execution, and monitoring. Detail their responsibilities in resource management, communication, and risk management.

   - **Integration with Team**: Explain how these external parties will integrate with the internal team and contribute to project governance.

6. **Quality Assurance and Compliance**:
