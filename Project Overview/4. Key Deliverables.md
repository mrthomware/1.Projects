Creating a list of key deliverables is an essential part of project planning, as it provides a clear and tangible set of goals for the project team. Each deliverable should be specific and measurable. Here's a template for outlining the Key Deliverables in a project:

### Key Deliverables

#### Deliverable 1
- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the first major output or product the project will produce. This should include the specifications, features, and functions of the deliverable.
- **Purpose**: Explain the purpose or significance of this deliverable in relation to the overall project objectives.
- **Completion Criteria**: Define what constitutes completion or success for this deliverable. Include specific standards or benchmarks that need to be met.
- **Responsible Parties**: Identify who in the project team is responsible for delivering this output.
- **Due Date**: Specify the deadline or timeline for the completion of this deliverable.

#### Deliverable 2
- **Description**: [Detail the second key deliverable, outlining its features, specifications, and any relevant details.]
- **Purpose**: [Clarify how this deliverable contributes to the project's overall goals and objectives.]
- **Completion Criteria**: [Define the criteria that will be used to assess whether this deliverable has been successfully completed.]
- **Responsible Parties**: [List the team members or departments responsible for creating and delivering this output.]
- **Due Date**: [Indicate the expected completion date or timeframe for this deliverable.]

#### Additional Deliverables
- **Deliverable 3, 4, ...**: [Continue to list additional deliverables following the same format, ensuring each one is well-defined with clear completion criteria and responsible parties.]

This structured approach to defining key deliverables ensures that each output is clearly understood, properly managed, and aligned with the project's objectives. It also facilitates accountability and helps in tracking the progress of the project
