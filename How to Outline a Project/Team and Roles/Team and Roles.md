In project management, defining the team and their roles is vital for ensuring that everyone knows their responsibilities and how they contribute to the project's success. Here's a guide to structuring a project team and outlining roles:

1. **Project Manager**: Leads the project, responsible for planning, execution, monitoring, control, and closure of the project. They are the primary point of contact for stakeholders and manage the team's performance.

2. **Project Sponsor**: Typically a senior executive who champions the project within the organization. They provide guidance, resources, and decision-making support.

3. **Project Team Members**: Individuals who carry out the project tasks. Their roles vary depending on the project's nature and may include engineers, designers, analysts, and other specialists.

4. **Business Analyst**: Responsible for gathering and analyzing project requirements, ensuring that the solutions proposed meet the business needs.

5. **Technical Lead/Architect**: Oversees the technical aspects of the project, ensuring that the technical resources are used effectively and meet project specifications.

6. **Quality Assurance (QA) Manager**: Ensures that the project's deliverables meet the required quality standards through testing and validation.

7. **Resource Manager**: Manages human and material resources, ensuring that the project has the necessary resources when needed.

8. **Change Manager**: Responsible for managing change requests and ensuring that changes are smoothly integrated into the project with minimal disruption.

9. **Risk Manager**: Identifies, analyzes, and manages project risks, ensuring that risk management strategies are in place.

10. **Communications Coordinator**: Manages internal and external communications, ensuring that stakeholders are kept informed about the project's progress and any issues.

11. **Financial Analyst/Controller**: Manages the project budget, tracking expenses, and ensuring that the project remains financially viable.

12. **Stakeholder Representatives**: Individuals representing different stakeholder groups who provide input, feedback, and requirements to ensure the project aligns with stakeholder needs.

13. **Support Roles**: Include administrative support, HR personnel, and other roles that provide ancillary support to the project team.

It's important to define these roles clearly at the beginning of the project and communicate them to all team members and stakeholders. Depending on the project's size and complexity, some individuals may take on multiple roles, or some roles may be combined. Regular team meetings and clear communication channels should be established to ensure effective collaboration and coordination among team members.

To structure a project team effectively and outline the roles as per your guide, I'll create a template that encompasses the essential roles and responsibilities in project management. This template can serve as a foundational document for defining team structure and roles in any project. It will also include YAML Front Matter to organize and categorize the document efficiently.

Here's the template:

```yaml

title: "Project Team Structure and Roles"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # Date of document creation or last update
project: "Project Name"
document_type: "Team Structure"
