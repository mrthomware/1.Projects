Graphical or tabular representation of task dependencies.

- Task [X] depends on the completion of Task [Y]

Managing task dependencies effectively is crucial for successful project execution. Dependencies determine the order in which tasks must be completed and can significantly impact the project timeline. Here’s a template for representing task dependencies either graphically or in a tabular format:

### Task Dependencies

#### Tabular Representation

| Dependent Task (X) | Dependency (Y) | Description of Dependency |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Task 2             | Task 1         | Task 2 can start only after Task 1 is completed. |
| Task 3             | Task 2         | Task 3 depends on the outcomes of Task 2. |
| Task 4             | Task 1         | Task 4 requires inputs that are generated from Task 1. |
| ...                | ...            | ...                       |

#### Graphical Representation
- **Gantt Chart**: A Gantt chart can visually map out the project timeline and show the dependencies between tasks. Each task is represented as a bar, with the length indicating duration. Arrows between bars show dependencies.
- **Network Diagram**: This is a flowchart that illustrates the relationships between different tasks. Each task is a node in the network, and arrows indicate dependencies.

#### Types of Dependencies
- **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: A task can start only after a previous task finishes (most common type).
- **Start-to-Start (SS)**: A task can start only after another task starts, but both can run concurrently.
- **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: A task can finish only after another task finishes.
- **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: A task can finish only after another task starts.

#### Considerations for Managing Dependencies
- **Identifying Critical Path**: The critical path is the sequence of tasks that determines the minimum project duration. Delay in any task on this path will delay the entire project.
- **Flexibility and Buffer Time**: It’s important to allow some buffer time for tasks with tight dependencies to accommodate any delays.
- **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Dependencies should be reviewed regularly as changes in one task can affect others.

Using either a tabular or graphical representation helps in visualizing the interconnections between tasks, thereby enabling better planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.
