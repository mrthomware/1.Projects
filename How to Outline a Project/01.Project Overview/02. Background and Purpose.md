Sure, let's outline a template for the "Background and Purpose" section of a project management document:

### Background and Purpose

#### Context
- **Overview**: Provide a brief description of the environment or setting in which the project is being initiated. This could include industry background, organizational context, market trends, or technological advancements relevant to the project.
- **Historical Background**: Outline any previous efforts, projects, or circumstances that have led to the current project. This can include past successes, failures, or gaps that have been identified.
- **Stakeholder Analysis**: Identify the key stakeholders involved or affected by the project, and describe their interests, expectations, and level of influence.

#### Problem/Opportunity
- **Identification of the Problem or Opportunity**: Clearly articulate the specific problem or opportunity that the project is designed to address. This should be a concise statement that defines what needs to be solved or capitalized upon.
- **Impact Analysis**: Discuss the potential impact or consequences of not addressing the problem or the benefits of seizing the opportunity. This could include financial, operational, strategic, or social impacts.
- **Goals and Objectives**: Define the primary goals and objectives of the project. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
- **Alignment with Organizational Strategy**: Explain how the project aligns with the broader goals or strategic objectives of the organization. This helps in justifying the project's relevance and importance.

This template provides a structured way to present the background and purpose of a project, ensuring that all relevant aspects are considered and clearly communicated.
