### Version Control Methods
- **Document Versioning Convention**:

- **Archiving Policy**:
  - Develop a policy for archiving old versions of documents. Decide how long to keep old versions and where they will be archived.
- **Retrieval Process**:
  - Ensure there is a clear process for retrieving archived versions if needed for reference or audit purposes.

### Training and Documentation
- **Training for Team Members**:
  - Provide training to all team members on version control practices, including how to name, update, and archive documents.
- **Documentation of Version Control Procedures**:
  - Document and share the version control procedures with the team to ensure consistent practices across the project.

### Integration with Project Tools
