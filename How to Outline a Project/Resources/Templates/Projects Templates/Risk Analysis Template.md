# Risk Analysis Template

## Qualitative Analysis

- Description: Perform a qualitative analysis of the identified risks, focusing on the likelihood of each risk occurring and the potential impact it would have on the project. This analysis should provide an understanding of which risks are most critical and should be prioritized for mitigation.

### Risk 1
- **Likelihood**: [Assess the likelihood of this risk occurring.]
- **Impact**: [Evaluate the potential impact on the project if this risk materializes.]

### Risk 2
- **Likelihood**: [Assess the likelihood of this risk occurring.]
- **Impact**: [Evaluate the potential impact on the project if this risk materializes.]

## Quantitative Analysis

- Description: If applicable, provide a quantitative analysis of risks. This involves probabilistic risk assessment, where you assign numerical values to both the likelihood of a risk occurring and its potential impact. This analysis helps in understanding the potential effect of risks on project objectives in quantifiable terms.

### Risk 1
- **Probability (in %)**: [Assign a probability percentage to this risk.]
- **Quantified Impact**: [Provide a numerical estimate of the impact, such as cost, time delay, etc.]

### Risk 2
- **Probability (in %)**: [Assign a probability percentage to this risk.]
- **Quantified Impact**: [Provide a numerical estimate of the impact, such as cost, time delay, etc.]

*This template is intended to systematically analyze and prioritize risks, allowing for more effective risk management and mitigation strategies in the project.*
