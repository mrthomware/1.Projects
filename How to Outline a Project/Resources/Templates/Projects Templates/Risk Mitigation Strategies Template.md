## Mitigation Plans

- Description: Describe the mitigation plans for high-priority risks. This includes the specific actions and strategies that will be implemented to reduce the likelihood of these risks occurring or to lessen their impact if they do occur.

### High-Priority Risk 1
- **Mitigation Strategy**: [Detail the specific actions and measures that will be taken to mitigate this risk.]

### High-Priority Risk 2

## Contingency Plans

### Potential Risk 2
- **Contingency Plan**: [Describe the specific actions and responses that will be taken if this risk materializes.]
