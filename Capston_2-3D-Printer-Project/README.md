## About the Course

In this course, students apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired in the program to a real-world project. The project involves designing, building, and testing an automated system or robot.

Apply knowledge gained in the program to design, construct, and demonstrate a fully functional application-based automated system. Projects contain elements and components in pneumatics controls, robotic arm manipulation, PLC programming, sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers.

In this course, students will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills acquired throughout the program to a real-world project. The project focuses on designing, constructing, and demonstrating a fully functional automated system or robot that is application-based.

The project will incorporate various elements and components related to pneumatics controls, robotic arm manipulation, PLC programming, sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers. Students will be required to integrate these different aspects into a cohesive and functional system.

## Learning Outcomes   
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  
1. Construct a fully automated system and apply it to a real-world application model.  
2. Integrate various sensors for specific tasks.  
3. Control actuators such as motors, and solenoid valves.  
4. Integrate industrial PLC into automated system.  
5. Integrate Robotic Arm into an automated process.  
6. Work in teams.  

## Course Content and Topics
Specifications for the project will be derived from student project interest and/or from collaboration with related industry.
This is a capstone project.

## Here is an overview of the different components and their roles within the project:

1. **Pneumatics Controls**: Students will utilize pneumatics to control the movement and operation of different parts of the automated system. This may involve designing and implementing pneumatic circuits, valves, and actuators to control the system's movements.

2. **Robotic Arm Manipulation**: The project will involve the design and implementation of a robotic arm that can manipulate objects or perform specific tasks. Students will need to understand the principles of robotic arm kinematics and dynamics to ensure accurate and precise movements.

3. **PLC Programming**: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are widely used in industrial automation. Students will learn how to program PLCs to control and coordinate the various components of the automated system. This programming will involve creating logic, defining inputs and outputs, and implementing control algorithms.

4. **Sensors**: Sensors play a crucial role in an automated system, providing feedback and input to control its operation. Students will select and integrate sensors such as proximity sensors, vision systems, or force sensors to enable the system to perceive and interact with its environment effectively.

5. **Actuators**: Actuators are responsible for translating control signals into physical motion or actions. Students will work with different types of actuators, such as motors, pneumatic cylinders, or solenoid valves, and integrate them into the system to achieve the desired functionality.

6. **Microcontrollers**: Microcontrollers act as the brain of the automated system, processing inputs, executing control algorithms, and generating outputs. Students will program microcontrollers to interface with various components, manage data flow, and ensure the overall system's functionality.

Throughout the project, students will go through the design, construction, and testing phases to iteratively refine their automated system. They will apply theoretical knowledge gained in the program, problem-solving skills, and engineering principles to address challenges and achieve a fully functional application-based automated system.

By the end of the course, students will not only have a comprehensive understanding of the individual components but also the ability to integrate them into a cohesive system that meets specific project requirements. This hands-on experience will enhance their practical skills and prepare them for real-world applications in automation and robotics.
