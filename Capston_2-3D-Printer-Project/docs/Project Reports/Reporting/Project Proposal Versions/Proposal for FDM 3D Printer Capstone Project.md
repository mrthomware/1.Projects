### Proposal for FDM 3D Printer Capstone Project

#### Executive Summary
This proposal outlines a three-month capstone project aimed at designing and developing a functional Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D Printer. Our focus is on creating a cost-effective, user-friendly, and efficient printer that stands out in the current market. The project will be undertaken by two team members, Person A and Person B, each bringing unique skills and perspectives to the project.

#### Introduction
The field of 3D printing has seen exponential growth, with FDM being one of the most accessible and popular methods. Despite the variety of FDM printers available, there is still room for innovation, particularly in terms of cost-efficiency, precision, and user experience. This project aims to address these areas while also providing a learning platform for advanced manufacturing technologies.
