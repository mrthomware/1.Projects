Given that the project is intended to run for a duration of 4 months, the annual budget of $386,265 needs to be prorated to reflect this shorter timeframe. Here's how the budget components can be adjusted:

### Adjusted 4-Month Project Budget

#### 1. Material Costs
- These costs are largely dependent on the rate of consumption. For a 4-month period, you would calculate this based on actual usage projections. However, for simplicity, we can assume a linear usage and divide the annual estimate by 3 (since 4 months is approximately 1/3 of a year).
- **Adjusted Material Costs**: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \$3,250 = \$1,083.33 \)

#### 2. Equipment Costs
- These are one-time costs and would remain the same regardless of project duration.
- **Adjusted Equipment Costs**: \$5,250

#### 3. Software and Licensing Costs
- These costs are typically annual subscriptions, but some software providers offer monthly subscriptions or prorated charges.
- **Adjusted Software Costs**: \( \frac{4}{12} \times \$1,000 = \$333.33 \)

#### 4. Labor Costs
- Salaries should be adjusted to reflect the 4-month period.
- **Adjusted Labor Costs**: \( \frac{4}{12} \times \$272,500 = \$90,833.33 \)

#### 5. Overhead Costs
- These are monthly costs, so they should be calculated for 4 months.
- **Adjusted Overhead Costs**: \( 4 \times \$9,000 + 4 \times \$1,800 + 4 \times \$33,000 + \$750 + 4 \times \$4,200 + 4 \times \$18,000 + 4 \times \$2,400 = \$227,150 \)

#### 6. Contingency Fund
- This should be 10% of the adjusted subtotal.
- **Adjusted Contingency**: 10% of the new subtotal.

### Total Adjusted Budget Calculation
1. **Subtotal (Before Contingency)**: \$1,083.33 + \$5,250 + \$333.33 + \$90,833.33 + \$227,150 = **\$324,650**
2. **Adjusted Contingency Fund**: 10% of \$324,650 = **\$32,465**

### Total Project Budget for 4 Months
- **Total**: \$324,650 + \$32,465 = **\$357,115**

This adjusted total budget of \$357,115 is an estimate for the 4-month duration of the project. It's important to note that while some costs like equipment are one-time expenses and do not change with the project duration, other costs like labor and overheads are time-dependent and have been adjusted accordingly. Regular monitoring and adjustments are recommended to ensure the budget remains aligned with the project's progress and any changes in scope or market conditions.

You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. Let's re-calculate the 4-month budget based on the original annual budget of $386,265.

### Recalculating the 4-Month Project Budget

The original annual budget is $386,265. Since 4 months is approximately one-third of a year, we can adjust most of the annual costs to a third for the 4-month period. However, one-time costs like equipment will remain the same.

#### Adjusted 4-Month Project Budget

1. **Material Costs**: 
   - Annual: $3,250
   - 4-Month: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \$3,250 = \$1,083.33 \)

2. **Equipment Costs** (One-time Costs): 
   - 4-Month: $5,250 (unchanged)

3. **Software and Licensing Costs**: 
   - Annual: $1,000
   - 4-Month: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \$1,000 = \$333.33 \)

4. **Labor Costs**: 
   - Annual: $272,500
   - 4-Month: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \$272,500 = \$90,833.33 \)

5. **Overhead Costs**: 
   - Annual: $69,150
   - 4-Month: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \$69,150 = \$23,050 \)

6. **Contingency Fund**: 
   - Annual: $35,115
   - 4-Month: \( \frac{1}{3} \times \$35,115 = \$11,705 \)

### Total Adjusted Budget for 4 Months
- **Subtotal (Before Contingency)**: $1,083.33 + $5,250 + $333.33 + $90,833.33 + $23,050 = **$120,550**
- **Adjusted Contingency Fund**: $11,705

- **Total 4-Month Budget**: $120,550 + $11,705 = **$132,255**

This revised total of $132,255 is a more accurate estimate for the 4-month duration of the project. It includes proportional adjustments to the annual costs for materials, software, labor, and overheads, while keeping one-time costs constant. The contingency fund is also adjusted to reflect the shorter project duration.
