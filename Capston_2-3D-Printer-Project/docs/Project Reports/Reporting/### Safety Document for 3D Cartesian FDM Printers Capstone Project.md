The document you provided is titled "Safety in Industrial Robots" and is part of the ELTR 217: Robotics course, instructed by Mandeep Kaur. It focuses on the safety aspects of industrial robots, discussing the potential risks and the lack of specific safety standards provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). To create a safety document for your 3D Cartesian FDM Printers capstone project, I will use relevant information from this document and tailor it to the specific context of 3D printers.

The safety document will cover several key areas:

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of 3D Cartesian FDM Printers and their industrial applications.
2. **Hazards Associated with 3D Printing**: Identification of potential risks specific to 3D printing.
3. **Safety Standards and Regulations**: Applicable safety guidelines and standards for 3D printers.
4. **Safety Protocols and Procedures**: Specific safety measures and best practices to be followed.
5. **Emergency Response Plan**: Procedures to handle accidents or malfunctions.
6. **Maintenance and Inspection**: Regular maintenance and inspection guidelines to ensure safe operation.
7. **Training and Awareness**: Importance of training for operators and personnel working with 3D printers.
8. **Conclusion**: Summary of the key safety considerations.

Drafting the document based on these points.

### Safety Document for 3D Cartesian FDM Printers Capstone Project

#### Introduction
3D Cartesian Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printers are advanced devices used in various industries to create three-dimensional objects by layering materials. These printers offer significant benefits in manufacturing and prototyping but come with unique safety considerations due to their operational mechanisms and the materials they use.

#### Hazards Associated with 3D Printing
- **Thermal Hazards**: High temperatures of the extruder can cause burns.
- **Chemical Hazards**: Emissions from heated printing materials can be harmful if inhaled.
- **Mechanical Hazards**: Moving parts pose a risk of injury.
- **Electrical Hazards**: Risks associated with electrical components and wiring.

#### Safety Standards and Regulations
While specific standards for 3D printers are not established by OSHA, it's vital to adhere to general workplace safety guidelines. Additionally, following manufacturer-specific safety instructions for the 3D printer is crucial.

#### Safety Protocols and Procedures
1. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Use of gloves, safety glasses, and respiratory protection when necessary.
2. **Workspace Safety**: Adequate ventilation, keeping the area around the printer clear of clutter.
3. **Operating Procedures**: Never touch the extruder or moving parts during operation; follow proper startup and shutdown procedures.

#### Emergency Response Plan
- **In case of Burns**: Use first aid measures and seek medical attention if severe.
- **In case of Equipment Malfunction**: Power off the printer immediately and follow troubleshooting guides.

#### Maintenance and Inspection
Regular maintenance should include:
- Checking electrical connections.
- Inspecting mechanical parts for wear and tear.
- Verifying the proper functioning of safety features.

#### Training and Awareness
Operators should receive training on:
- The specific model of the 3D printer being used.
- Recognizing and mitigating potential hazards.
- Proper use of PPE.

#### Conclusion
Safety in the use of 3D Cartesian FDM Printers is paramount. Understanding and mitigating the risks associated with their operation ensures a safe and productive environment. This document should be reviewed regularly, and updates should be made as new safety information becomes available.
