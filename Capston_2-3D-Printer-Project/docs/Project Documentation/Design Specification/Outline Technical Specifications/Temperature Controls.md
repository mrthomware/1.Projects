### Temperature Controls
1. **Extruder Heating**: Detail the maximum temperature the extruder can reach, which determines the types of materials that can be printed.

2. **Print Bed Heating**: Specify the heating capabilities of the print bed, including the maximum achievable temperature.

3. **Temperature Stability**: Discuss how the printer maintains a stable temperature, which is crucial for print quality, especially with materials that are prone to warping.
