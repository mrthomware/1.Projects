### Safety Features
1. **Thermal Runaway Protection**: Ensure the printer firmware includes thermal runaway protection, which shuts down heating elements if abnormal temperature readings are detected.

2. **Emergency Stop**: Include an easily accessible emergency stop switch to immediately halt all printer operations if needed.

3. **Enclosed Printing Area**: For printers designed to work with high-temperature materials, consider an enclosed print area to maintain temperature stability and user safety.

4. **Ventilation**: Detail any built-in ventilation systems, especially important when printing with materials that emit fumes.

5. **Electrical Safety**: Outline features like power supply protection, grounded components, and quality wiring to prevent electrical hazards.
