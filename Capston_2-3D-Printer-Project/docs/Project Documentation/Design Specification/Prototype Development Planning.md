### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the planning phase for the development of a prototype for our FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3D Printer. This stage is crucial in turning our refined design concepts into a tangible, working model.

### 2. Objectives

- To create a detailed plan for the development of the 3D printer prototype.
- To ensure the prototype meets all specified technical and design requirements.
- To establish a timeline and resource allocation for prototype development.

### 3. Prototype Development Plan

#### 3.1 Design Finalization
- **Task:** Finalize the design based on feedback from the Preliminary Design Review.
- **Responsible Team:** Design and Engineering.
- **Timeline:** February 2 - February 9, 2024.

#### 3.2 Component Sourcing
- **Task:** Procure all necessary components, including custom parts.
- **Responsible Team:** Procurement and Engineering.
- **Timeline:** February 10 - February 17, 2024.

#### 3.3 Assembly and Integration
- **Task:** Assemble the prototype, integrating mechanical, electronic, and software components.
- **Responsible Team:** Engineering and IT.
- **Timeline:** February 18 - February 25, 2024.

#### 3.4 Initial Testing
- **Task:** Conduct initial tests to check functionality and performance.
- **Responsible Team:** Quality Assurance and Engineering.
- **Timeline:** February 26 - March 3, 2024.

### 4. Resource Allocation

- **Human Resources:** Allocation of engineers, designers, technicians, and quality assurance staff.
- **Material Resources:** Procurement of components, including filament materials, electronic parts, and frame materials.
- **Financial Resources:** Budget allocation for components, labor, and potential outsourced services.

### 5. Risk Management

- **Supply Chain Delays:** Strategies to mitigate risks associated with delays in component delivery.
- **Technical Challenges:** Plan for technical support and expert consultation for unforeseen design or integration challenges.
- **Quality Control:** Regular checks and balances to ensure prototype meets quality standards.

### 6. Documentation and Reporting

- Maintaining comprehensive records of the development process, including design changes, test results, and stakeholder feedback.
- Regular reporting to project management and key stakeholders on progress and any significant issues.

### 7. Conclusion

The successful completion of the prototype development phase is critical for the project's progression to testing and eventual production stages. This plan lays the groundwork for a structured and efficient prototype development process.
