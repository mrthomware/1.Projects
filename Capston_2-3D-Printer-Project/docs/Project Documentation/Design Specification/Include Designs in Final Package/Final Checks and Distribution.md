### Final Checks and Distribution
1. **Review for Completeness**: Go through the entire package to ensure nothing is missing and all documents are up to date.

2. **Usability Testing**: Itâ€™s beneficial to have someone unfamiliar with the project review the package to ensure the content is understandable and user-friendly.

3. **Distribution Format**: Decide on the distribution format. This could be downloadable content from a website, a USB drive included with the printer kit, or an email with all necessary attachments.

4. **Update Mechanism**: Plan for how updates to the documentation will be communicated and distributed to users in the future.

5. **Legal and Licensing**: Include any legal information or user licensing agreements, especially if the design is proprietary or open-source.
