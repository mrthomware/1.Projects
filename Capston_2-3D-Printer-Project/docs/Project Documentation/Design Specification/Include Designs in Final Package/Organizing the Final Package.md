### Organizing the Final Package
1. **Digital Compilation**: Compile all documents, designs, and specifications in a digital format. Use a logical folder structure with clear naming conventions for easy navigation. For instance, separate folders for 'Assembly Instructions', 'Technical Specifications', 'CAD Models', etc.

2. **Readable Formats**: Ensure all documents are in widely accessible formats (e.g., PDF for documents, STL for 3D models).

3. **Interactive Elements**: If possible, include interactive elements like hyperlinks in documents for quick navigation, or 3D models that can be viewed and manipulated.

4. **Version Control**: Keep track of document versions to ensure users have the latest information. Include a change log or version history for transparency.
