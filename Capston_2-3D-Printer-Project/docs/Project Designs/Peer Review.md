### Peer Review
1. **Selection of Reviewers**: Choose individuals who have experience and expertise in 3D printing and mechanical design. This could include peers, mentors, or professionals in the field.

2. **Feedback Process**: Present your designs, assembly instructions, and technical documentation to the reviewers. Encourage them to provide honest and constructive feedback.

3. **Review Sessions**: If possible, organize review sessions where you can discuss the design and documentation in detail. This allows for immediate clarification and discussion of potential improvements.

4. **Iterative Revisions**: Use the feedback to make iterative improvements to your design and documentation. This may include revising designs, clarifying instructions, or adding additional information to the documentation.

5. **Final Validation**: Once revisions are made, seek final validation from the reviewers to ensure that all concerns have been addressed and the documentation is clear and comprehensive.
