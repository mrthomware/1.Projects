### Custom Parts
1. **Identification**: Identify components that cannot be bought off-the-shelf and need to be custom-made. This may include certain frame parts, specialized brackets, or unique gears.

2. **Design and Fabrication**: 
   - Use CAD software to design these custom parts with precise dimensions.
   - Decide on the fabrication method (CNC machining, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc.) based on the material and required precision.

3. **Testing and Iteration**: Prototype and test these custom parts to ensure they meet the required specifications. Be prepared for multiple iterations.

4. **Integration**: Ensure that custom parts are fully compatible with other standard components in the printer.
