### Printing Capabilities
1. **Maximum Build Volume**: Specify the maximum dimensions that the printer can build in, typically given in length x width x height (e.g., 250mm x 250mm x 300mm).

2. **Layer Resolution**: Detail the minimum layer height the printer can achieve, often measured in micrometers. Lower numbers indicate higher resolution.

3. **Printing Speed**: Indicate the range of printing speeds in millimeters per second (mm/s), noting that higher speeds may affect print quality.

4. **Supported Materials**: List all materials that the printer can use, such as PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU, and more exotic filaments like carbon fiber infused or metal-filled materials.

5. **Print Bed Features**: Include information about the print bed, such as whether it's heated, its maximum temperature, and any special coatings or surfaces for improved adhesion.
