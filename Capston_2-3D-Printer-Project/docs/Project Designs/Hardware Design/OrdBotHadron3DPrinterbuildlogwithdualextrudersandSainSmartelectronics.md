## Transcript (Reformatted)

The backside of the Or Bot Hadron printer houses a 20-watt, 12-volt power supply that feeds into a Smart RAMPS 1.4 controller, the same as the Smart Arduino Mega2560 system installed at the front. The LCD is connected via black cables, which are foil-wrapped and coated in black electrical tape to prevent interference from crosstalk or noise from other wiring.

Although the wiring in the back appears disorganized, it operates effectively. The printer uses the same Smart end stops that feature switches, offering an advantage in terms of alignment and mounting. This ensures the system recognizes when it has reached the end stop.

Cable management is an important element, though my setup might not be the best example of it. Keeping the cables that connect to the moving parts of the printer secure is crucial to prevent them from becoming loose, getting trapped in the railing, chafing on sharp edges, or entangling in the gears. Loose cables can cause significant damage and necessitate rewiring.

To manage the cables, I spent around $10 on materials such as heat shrink, nylon mesh cable protection, and inexpensive plastic conduit. I also used a profuse amount of zip ties to secure everything. My extruder setup at the moment looks a bit haphazard as I've disassembled and reassembled it multiple times to get the arrangement right. I'm planning to tidy it up and secure loose parts to prevent them from moving unnecessarily.It is crucial when assembling the Word Bot Hadron mechanical frame, to ensure that the various V-rail posts are accurately lined up and squared; failing to do so could result in the stepper motors experiencing binding with the Z-axis or offset prints. Therefore, using a tool like a carpenter square is highly recommended to check and adjust 90-degree angles during assembly, ensuring the accuracy of all parts and rails. 

For example, it is essential to make sure the Y rail is perpendicular to the corresponding axis. The process may require some adjustments, but having it correctly assembled will help ensure good printing results. It's also wise to apply thread adhesive, such as Loctite, to the bolts to keep them firm in their places. However, avoid over-tightening to prevent stripping anything out. 

Although it may be tempting to skip some of these steps in anticipation of your first print, it is much better to take time and assemble everything correctly. Your prints might not turn out as desired if you don't put in this initial effort.

If you're setting up a dual extruder, as was the case for myself, expect to make many adjustments to perfect its alignment. Once this is done, you'll find that your effort was well worth it for the high-quality prints.Ensure that your printhead's z-axis aligns perfectly with the x and y axes. The y and x offsets can be adjusted using software. However, if one point is slightly lower than the other, it will be difficult to align the z-axis and correctly set your bed. Moreover, if you begin printing with one head and the other one slides over during the process, it could disrupt the print on the heated bed. Therefore, take your time to set it up as accurately as possible, and you'll be glad you did.

1.04: this is the back of the or bot hadron
3.6: printer with a 20 watt 12 volt power
7.04: supply
9.2: feeds into the same smart ramps 1.4
12.08: controller
13.2: with the same smart arduino mega2560
20.32: on the front we have the lcd which these
23.519: black
24.48: cables here are
26.08: have been foil wrapped and then covered
27.92: in
28.8: black electrical tape so that it keeps
31.039: out any
32.239: noise or crosstalk or anything coming
33.76: from any of the other wiring in the back
35.92: which is a little bit of a mess but uh
39.04: that it works
44.16: i'm using
45.68: the same smart
48.719: end stops that uh
50.719: have actual switches this gives a little
53.039: bit more uh
54.559: flexibility in mounting and aligning so
57.28: that you're sure that
58.96: it recognizes
61.359: that it's actually at the end
70.84: stop one thing i should point out not
73.52: that i have the the best example but uh
75.84: is cable management
77.52: uh you want to make sure that you have
78.96: your uh you know any of your cables to
81.52: that go to any of the moving parts
84.0: uh protected because you don't want just
85.84: loose wires dangling and and coming up
88.32: because they'll they can get jammed up
89.92: inside the uh
91.36: your railing or you know they could get
94.32: chafed on uh you know
96.24: sharp or semi-sharp eye edges or even
99.04: get caught up in your gears
100.72: and
101.6: if you do that you're gonna cause all
103.68: kinds of damage your rewiring and all
105.68: that sort of stuff so
107.52: spend a couple bucks i spend a total of
109.68: like ten dollars on all the uh
111.92: the
112.64: cable management stuff you know the i
114.479: got some
115.759: heat shrink i got this uh expanding uh
118.88: uh nylon mesh
121.92: uh
123.119: cable protecting material and then this
126.0: uh just cheap plastic
128.879: conduit that uh i ran everything through
131.44: and use plenty of zip ties they're cheap
133.84: use them
134.879: and make sure that you know you you get
137.68: all your cables and wires protected
139.84: it's a little bit of a mess right here
141.44: on my extruder setup and that's because
143.44: i put it together and i took it apart
145.44: and put it together and took it apart
147.28: and
148.319: i think i have it set exactly how i need
150.4: it everything so i'm going to go ahead
151.92: and button these down and make it look a
154.0: little bit neater and make sure that
156.08: these things aren't
157.28: flopping around in the wind and also
159.44: try to offset these a little bit from
161.2: the motor so that the the motors can get
163.2: a little bit more air
169.28: when putting together the word bot
170.879: hadron uh
172.16: frame mechanical frame with the the
174.64: stepper motors it's very very critical
176.72: to
177.519: get the uh
178.959: the various v-rail posts
181.04: lined up and squared as best as you can
184.319: the uh
185.36: if you just bolt it together and just
186.879: kind of eyeball it your
189.44: you're going to have some binding
190.56: possibly with your z-axis or you're
192.879: going to have uh some offset prints and
195.76: trying to
197.68: calibrate and
199.519: level your heated bed
201.599: is going to be a nightmare
203.599: so i highly recommend just a simple
205.76: little uh
207.2: you know carpenter square something that
209.2: makes it really easy to go and
211.36: check your 90 degree angles to
214.159: compare
216.319: and adjust
217.84: what i did was i loosely
220.48: assembled each bit of the
223.2: mechanical
224.56: railing and and parts
226.4: and i use this to
228.239: set up and check
230.319: at you know the various angles like for
232.64: right here
235.04: and here
236.4: and uh
239.04: you know don't forget about your your
240.959: actual y
242.72: rail here
243.84: you want to make sure that this
245.92: is perpendicular as
247.92: best as you can to this uh
251.36: this axis here
253.2: so
254.879: it may be hard to see but
256.72: you know you get the idea you're going
258.079: to want to put this in there and double
260.079: check that
262.479: that it's lined up just right
264.56: and you know it's going to take some
265.759: adjusting some tweaking and peaking but
268.56: once you do it you'll be very glad you
270.4: did you know make sure you put some
272.479: loctite or some kind of uh
274.56: you know
275.44: thread adhesive to uh the bolts that
278.88: that you put in so that
280.56: once you do it you know they stay put
283.12: and you know crank them down but don't
284.96: don't overdo it so you don't want to you
286.88: know strip anything out
289.199: um
290.4: but it you know it's it's imperative
292.08: that you uh take the time and putting it
294.08: together it may be exciting to get this
295.68: thing going and try to do a test print
297.44: but it your print's going to come out
299.28: like garbage if you don't do the little
301.44: bit of due diligence beforehand
303.759: and
304.72: and put it together properly
307.52: now once you've done
308.84: that aligning your
311.44: if you're doing a dual extruder setup
312.96: like i did here
314.4: you're going to have a lot of
318.0: adjustments and a lot of things you're
319.52: going to need to do to make sure that
320.639: each
321.759: point of your
322.84: printhead the z-axis is set up just
325.52: right
326.639: with the the x and y so the the y offset
330.16: and the
330.96: x offset
332.639: it's uh
334.24: that can be adjusted in software but if
337.36: you know one point is a little lower
339.68: than the other
341.28: one you're not going to be able to line
342.4: up your z-axis and get your bla your bed
345.039: set right
346.32: but
347.12: if you start to print with one when the
349.52: other one slides over when you're
351.12: printing somewhere over here it's going
352.88: to knock it and you're going to knock
354.96: your print off your uh your heated bed
357.28: so
358.56: take your time get it set as best as you
361.52: can
362.479: and you'll be very glad you did
406.08: okay
