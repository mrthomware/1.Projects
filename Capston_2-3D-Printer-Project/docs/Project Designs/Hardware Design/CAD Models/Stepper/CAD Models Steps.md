### CAD Models
1. **Choose a CAD Software**: Select a CAD software suitable for mechanical design, like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, or Fusion 360.
2. **Sketch the Basic Design**: Start by sketching the basic shape and dimensions of the printer, considering the print volume, frame size, and overall design.
3. **Design Individual Components**: 
   - **Frame**: Design the frame ensuring it's sturdy and stable.
   - **Print Bed**: Create the design for a flat, level print bed, adjustable for different materials.
   - **Extruder**: Design the extruder, considering factors like the type of filament, heating capacity, and nozzle design.
   - **Moving Parts**: Include gears, belts, pulleys, and motors that drive the movement of the print head and bed.
4. **Ensure Precision**: Make sure all dimensions are precise, and components fit together seamlessly, considering tolerances.
5. **Component Compatibility**: Ensure that electronic components like motors, sensors, and control boards are well-integrated into the design.
6. **Ventilation and Wiring Paths**: Include design provisions for effective ventilation and neat wiring paths.
