### Assembly Layout
1. **Exploded View Diagrams**: Create exploded view diagrams to show how each part fits into the overall assembly. This should clearly illustrate components like screws, nuts, bearings, and other small parts.
2. **Assembly Sequence**: Organize the parts in a logical assembly sequence, highlighting how they connect and in what order.
3. **Labeling**: Clearly label each part in the diagrams for easy identification.
4. **Instructions for Complex Assemblies**: Provide detailed instructions or notes for assemblies that are complex or require special attention.
5. **3D Visualization**: If possible, create a 3D exploded view that can be rotated and viewed from different angles for a better understanding.
6. **Use of Software Tools**: Utilize CAD software features that allow for easy creation of assembly layouts, such as the exploded view function in SolidWorks.
