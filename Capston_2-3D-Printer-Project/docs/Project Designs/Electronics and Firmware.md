### Electronics and Firmware
1. **Control Board**: Specify the type and model of the control board, ensuring it has enough capacity for all the printer's functions and future upgrades.

2. **Stepper Motors**: Detail the specifications of the stepper motors, including their type, torque rating, and step accuracy.

3. **Sensors**: List the types of sensors used, such as thermistors for temperature measurement, endstops for axis calibration, and any advanced sensors like filament run-out detectors.

4. **Firmware**: Indicate the firmware that will be used, such as Marlin, RepRapFirmware, or others. Ensure compatibility with the chosen control board and the printerâ€™s hardware.
