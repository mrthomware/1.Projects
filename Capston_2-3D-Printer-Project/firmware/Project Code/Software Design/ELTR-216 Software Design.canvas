This involves parsing and executing G-code commands, which are the instructions used to control all aspects of the printing process.\n\n### Task 5: G-code Interpreter\n\n#### Framework for Parsing and Executing G-code Commands:\n\n1. **Define Basic Structure**:\n\n   * Start with a basic structure to read a line of G-code.\n\n   ```cpp\n   cppString readGCodeLine() {\n     String gCodeLine = \"\";\n     while (Serial.available()) {\n       char c = Serial.read();\n       if (c == '\\n') {\n           return gCodeLine;\n       } else {\n           gCodeLine += c;\n       }\n     }\n     return gCodeLine;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize Serial Communication**:\n\n   * Set up serial communication in the `setup()` function.\n\n   ```cpp\n   cppvoid setup() {\n     Serial.begin(115200);  // Start serial communication at 115200 baud rate\n     // Other initialization...\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Parse G-code Command**:\n\n   * Implement a function to parse G-code commands and parameters.\n\n   ```cpp\n   cppvoid parseGCode(String gCodeLine) {\n     if (gCodeLine.startsWith(\"G0\") || gCodeLine.startsWith(\"G1\")) {\n       // Handle linear movement (G0 and G1 commands)\n       // Extract coordinates (X, Y, Z, E) and move motors accordingly\n     }\n     // Add more conditions for other G-code commands\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **G-code Execution in Main Loop**:\n\n   * In the `loop()` function, read and execute G-code commands.\n\n   ```cpp\n   cppvoid loop() {\n     if (Serial.available() > 0) {\n       String gCodeLine = readGCodeLine();\n       parseGCode(gCodeLine);\n     }\n     // Additional code...\n   }\n   ```\n\n#### Important Notes:\n\n* **Command Parsing**: G-code commands can have various parameters (like `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `E` for position and extrusion). Your parsing function should be able to extract these values.\n* **Movement Commands**: Implement functions to move the stepper motors based on the parsed G-code commands.\n* **Safety and Validation**: Ensure that the G-code commands are valid and within the operational limits of the printer.\n* **Expandability**: Start with basic commands like `G0` and `G1`, and gradually add more G-code commands as needed.\n\nDeveloping a G-code interpreter is a complex task that requires a good understanding of the G-code language and how it translates to printer movements and operations. Begin with simple commands and incrementally build up the complexity.\n\n```lua\nluaAdvance to the next task: Creating a user interface for manual control and status monitoring.

Ideally, 20mm should be left.\n* **Calculate and Set New Extruder Steps**:\n  * If not 20mm, calculate the new steps per mm with the same formula as for the axes.\n  * Update using `M92` and `M500`.\n\n### 3\\. **Optimal Print Quality**:\n\n* **Layer Height Tuning**:\n\n  * Start with a layer height that is 80% of your nozzle diameter.\n  * Test different layer heights for the best balance of speed and quality.\n\n* **Temperature Calibration**:\n\n  * Conduct temperature towers to find the optimal printing temperature for your filament.\n  * Look for the temperature that yields the best layer adhesion and surface finish.\n\n* **Retraction Settings**:\n\n  * Test different retraction distances and speeds to minimize stringing and oozing.\n  * Be cautious of too much retraction, which can lead to clogs.\n\n* **Print Speed Adjustments**:\n\n  * Slower speeds often yield better quality but increase print times.\n  * Find a balance between speed and quality suitable for your needs.\n\n* **Fan Speed**:\n\n  * Adjust cooling fan speeds for different materials.\n  * PLA usually benefits from more cooling, while ABS requires controlled cooling.\n\n* **Bed Leveling and First Layer**:\n\n  * Ensure your bed is level and the first layer is perfectly dialed in.\n  * A good first layer is crucial for the rest of the print.\n\n### 4\\. **Periodic Maintenance Checks**:\n\n* Regularly check and tighten belts and screws.\n* Lubricate moving parts as needed.\n* Keep the firmware updated.\n\nBy carefully calibrating and maintaining your 3D printer, you can achieve high-quality prints consistently.
