FDM 3D Printer Program for Arduino:

```c++
#include <Stepper.h>

// Define pin assignments and constants
const int stepsPerRevolution = 200;  // Steps per revolution for your stepper motor
const int X_pin1 = 2;  // X-axis stepper motor pins
const int X_pin2 = 3;
const int X_pin3 = 4;
const int X_pin4 = 5;
const int heaterPin = 6;       // Heater pin
const int thermistorPin = A0;  // Thermistor pin

// Stepper motor steps per mm (adjust based on your printer's configuration)

TODO:

The provided code is complete in terms of a basic setup for controlling a stepper motor and reading a thermistor in a 3D printer-like system, with added functionality for interpreting simple G-code commands. However, depending on the complexity and requirements of your specific project, there might be additional features or improvements you could consider:

1. **More Complex G-Code Handling**: The current implementation only processes simple G1 commands for linear movement. For more complex 3D printer or CNC applications, you might need to handle a wider range of G-code commands, including but not limited to G0 (rapid movement), G2/G3 (arc movements), G28 (homing), etc.

2. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling in response to invalid G-code commands or hardware malfunctions (like stepper motor stalls) is not implemented. Adding error checking and appropriate responses would improve the reliability of the system.

3. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Implementing feedback mechanisms, such as endstops for axis movement limits or encoders for verifying stepper motor steps, can greatly enhance precision and reliability.

4. **Temperature Control for the Heater**: If the heater is part of a temperature control system (like a 3D printer's extruder or heated bed), you will need a control loop (like PID control) to maintain a target temperature, rather than just reading the temperature.

5. **Safety Features**: Implement safety checks, such as thermal runaway protection if the temperature reading fails or exceeds safe limits, and emergency stop capabilities.

6. **User Interface**: Depending on your application, a user interface (either physical or through a connected computer) might be necessary for easier control and monitoring.

7. **Calibration Routines**: Implement routines for calibrating the stepper motors, thermistor, and any other sensors to ensure accuracy.

8. **Documentation and Comments**: Ensure your code is well-documented and commented, particularly if it's for a complex system or if it's going to be used or maintained by others.

9. **Optimization and Testing**: Test the system thoroughly under various conditions and optimize the code for efficiency, particularly if running on limited hardware resources like a microcontroller.

10. **Modular Design**: Consider structuring your code to be more modular, making it easier to maintain, extend, or reuse parts of it for different projects.

These are general suggestions and may or may not apply depending on the specific requirements and context of your project.

Revision 2:

Creating a fully functional 3D printer firmware from scratch is a very complex task. The code provided earlier gives a basic framework, but implementing all the details for each placeholder requires in-depth knowledge of the hardware, as well as significant coding expertise. For a complete and safe 3D printer, established firmware like Marlin or Repetier is typically used and customized for specific hardware configurations.

However, I can provide more detailed pseudocode to illustrate how you might start to fill in those placeholders for a basic operation. This will still be a simplified illustration and far from a complete firmware.

```cpp
#include <AccelStepper.h>

// Motor pin assignments for RAMPS 1.4
const int X_pin1 = 54; // X-axis stepper motor pins
const int X_pin2 = 55;
const int Y_pin1 = 60; // Y-axis stepper motor pins
const int Y_pin2 = 61;
const int Z_pin1 = 46; // Z-axis stepper motor pins
const int Z_pin2 = 47;
const int E_pin1 = 26; // Extruder stepper motor pins
const int E_pin2 = 27;

// Endstop pin assignments
const int xMinPin = 3; // X-min endstop pin
const int yMinPin = 14; // Y-min endstop pin
const int zMinPin = 18; // Z-min endstop pin

// Temperature sensor pin assignments
int hotendTempPin = A13; // Analog input pin for hotend temperature
int heatedBedTempPin = A14; // Analog input pin for bed temperature

// Initialize stepper motors using AccelStepper
AccelStepper stepperX(AccelStepper::DRIVER, X_pin1, X_pin2);
AccelStepper stepperY(AccelStepper::DRIVER, Y_pin1, Y_pin2);
AccelStepper stepperZ(AccelStepper::DRIVER, Z_pin1, Z_pin2);
AccelStepper stepperE(AccelStepper::DRIVER, E_pin1, E_pin2);

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial communication
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Setup stepper motors
  stepperX.setMaxSpeed(1000);
  stepperY.setMaxSpeed(1000);
  stepperZ.setMaxSpeed(100);
  stepperE.setMaxSpeed(1000);

  stepperX.setAcceleration(1000);
  stepperY.setAcceleration(1000);
  stepperZ.setAcceleration(100);
  stepperE.setAcceleration(1000);

  // Setup endstops
  pinMode(xMinPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(yMinPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(zMinPin, INPUT);

  // Additional setup code for temperature control, LCD, etc.
}

void loop() {
  // Read and process G-code commands
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    String command = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
    processGCode(command);
  }

  // Continuously check for endstop hits
  checkEndstops();

  // Continuously monitor temperature and manage heating
  controlTemperature();
}

void processGCode(String command) {
  // Parse and execute G-code command
  // Example: Handling G1 command for linear movement
  if (command.startsWith("G1")) {
    // Extract X, Y, Z, E values and convert them to steps
    // Move the steppers accordingly
    // Example: stepperX.moveTo(extractedXValueInSteps);
  }
  // More G-code commands parsing and handling goes here
}

void checkEndstops() {
  // Check if endstops are hit
  if (digitalRead(xMinPin) == LOW) {
    stepperX.stop(); // Stop X-axis movement
  }
  // Repeat for Y and Z endstops
}

void controlTemperature() {
  // Read temperature from thermistors
  int hotendTempReading = analogRead(hotendTempPin);
  int bedTempReading = analogRead(heatedBedTempPin);
  
  // Convert the readings to temperature
  // Example: float hotendTemp = convertToTemperature(hotendTempReading);
  
  // Control the heater
  // Example: analogWrite(heaterPin, calculatedPWMValue);
}

// Convert raw thermistor reading to temperature
float convertToTemperature(int reading) {
  // Conversion logic based on thermistor characteristics
  return calculatedTemperature;
}

// Additional functions as needed
```

This code attempts to outline basic motion control, endstop handling, and temperature reading. Note that this is still a highly simplified version. A complete and robust firmware requires much more, including but not limited to:

- Detailed motion planning and control.
- Precise temperature control with PID algorithms.
- Handling a wide range of G-code commands.
- Implementing safety features, like thermal runaway protection.
- User interface management for LCD displays and input devices.
- Calibration routines.
- Error handling and diagnostics.

Due to the complexity and risks associated with 3D printer firmware, it's highly recommended to start with a proven firmware base and modify it to suit your specific printer, unless you have significant experience in this area.

Creating a complete and functional firmware for a 3D printer is an extensive and complex task. The code provided so far forms only a basic outline and is far from a complete firmware. To complete this project, several key steps and considerations are necessary:

1. **Full G-Code Parsing**: Implement a comprehensive G-code parser that can handle all relevant G-code commands for 3D printing. This includes not only motion commands (like G0, G1) but also temperature control (like M104, M109), fan control, homing (G28), and other operational codes.

2. **Motion Planning and Control**: Develop or integrate a motion planning algorithm to efficiently and accurately move the printer's head and bed. This includes acceleration and deceleration control to prevent skipping steps and ensure print quality.

3. **Temperature Control and Management**: Implement precise temperature control for the hotend and heated bed. This typically involves PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithms to maintain stable temperatures.

4. **Safety Features**: Implement critical safety features such as thermal runaway protection, which turns off the heaters if the thermistor becomes disconnected or the temperature exceeds safe limits.

5. **Endstop Handling**: Enhance endstop handling to include not just emergency stops but also homing procedures for each axis.

6. **Calibration Routines**: Add routines for calibrating the printer, such as bed leveling, steps per mm calibration for each axis, and extruder calibration.

7. **User Interface**: If your printer has an LCD display and buttons or a rotary encoder, you'll need to implement a user interface to allow users to control the printer manually, start prints from an SD card, and adjust settings.

8. **SD Card Support**: Integrate SD card reading capabilities to print from G-code files stored on an SD card, including file navigation and selection through the user interface.

9. **Error Handling and Diagnostics**: Implement comprehensive error handling and diagnostic messages, which are crucial for troubleshooting and ensuring reliable printer operation.

10. **Extensive Testing and Debugging**: Once all features are implemented, a thorough testing and debugging phase is crucial. This should cover all aspects of printer operation to ensure reliability and safety.

11. **Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly, including setup instructions, calibration procedures, and user guidelines.

12. **Compliance with Standards**: Ensure your firmware complies with relevant standards and best practices for 3D printer firmware, particularly concerning safety.

13. **Community Feedback**: If possible, get feedback from the 3D printing community. Users can often identify issues that weren't apparent in initial testing.

Given the complexity involved, many 3D printer builders and enthusiasts opt to use existing firmware like Marlin or Repetier, which are already feature-rich, extensively tested, and widely supported. These firmware platforms are also customizable to fit different hardware configurations and printer designs. Building your firmware can be a rewarding learning experience, but for a reliable and safe 3D printer, leveraging existing solutions is usually the best approach.

Revision 3:
Creating a complete and functional firmware for a 3D printer is an immense task, and implementing it from scratch here is beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can provide you with more detailed code snippets and explanations for some of the key functionalities mentioned earlier. These snippets should serve as a starting point or guidance, but integrating them into a fully functional and safe firmware requires extensive additional work and expertise.

1. **Full G-Code Parsing**: Implementing a comprehensive G-code parser is a complex task. Below is a very basic implementation for handling a simple G1 command for linear movement.

    ```cpp
    void processGCode(String command) {
        if (command.startsWith("G1")) {
            // Extract X, Y, Z, E values and convert them to steps
            // Move the steppers accordingly
        }
        // Additional G-code commands parsing and handling...
    }
    ```

2. **Motion Planning and Control**: Implement motion control for the stepper motors. This is a simple implementation using the `AccelStepper` library.

    ```cpp
    void moveStepper(AccelStepper &stepper, long position) {
        stepper.moveTo(position);
        while (stepper.distanceToGo() != 0) {
            stepper.run();
        }
    }
    ```

3. **PID Temperature Control**: PID control for temperature management is complex and requires fine-tuning. Below is a conceptual example.

    ```cpp
    // Pseudocode for PID temperature control
    void manageTemperature(int targetTemp) {
        int currentTemp = readTemperature(hotendTempPin);
        int error = targetTemp - currentTemp;
        // Apply PID algorithm here to adjust heating power
    }
    ```

4. **Safety Features (Thermal Runaway)**: Implement safety checks, including thermal runaway protection.

    ```cpp
    void checkThermalRunaway() {
        if (abs(targetTemp - currentTemp) > MAX_TEMP_DIFF) {
            // Shut down heater and trigger alarm
        }
    }
    ```

5. **Endstop Handling and Homing**: Implement routines for homing each axis using endstops.

    ```cpp
    void homeAxis(AccelStepper &stepper, int endstopPin) {
        // Move stepper towards endstop
        // Check if endstop is reached
        // Set current position as home
    }
    ```

6. **Calibration Routines**: Include routines for calibrating the print bed, extruder, and axes. This is highly specific to your printer's hardware.

7. **User Interface and SD Card Support**: This depends on the specific hardware (LCD, buttons, etc.) used and might require libraries like `LiquidCrystal` for LCDs and `SD` for card reading.

8. **Error Handling and Diagnostics**: Implement comprehensive error handling and provide feedback for troubleshooting.

Please understand that each of these snippets requires substantial elaboration and integration into a cohesive firmware. This task demands a deep understanding of the printer's mechanical and electronic systems, and even with this understanding, developing a safe and reliable firmware is a significant challenge.

For most applications, it is advisable to start with an established firmware like Marlin, which is designed for 3D printers, and customize it for your specific needs. Marlin already includes the necessary features, optimizations, and safety checks, and it is well-supported and documented.

Revision 4:
Certainly, I can provide a sequential and expanded version of the 3D printer firmware code in multiple parts. This first part will include the necessary includes, definitions, and the setup function. Please note, due to the complexity of 3D printer firmware, this code is greatly simplified and intended for educational purposes. It will not be suitable for operating a real 3D printer without significant expansion and safety checks.

### Part 1: Initial Setup and Configuration

```cpp
#include <AccelStepper.h>

// Define motor pin assignments for RAMPS 1.4
const int X_pin1 = 54;  // X-axis stepper motor pins
const int X_pin2 = 55;
const int Y_pin1 = 60;  // Y-axis stepper motor pins
const int Y_pin2 = 61;
const int Z_pin1 = 46;  // Z-axis stepper motor pins
const int Z_pin2 = 47;
const int E_pin1 = 26;  // Extruder stepper motor pins
const int E_pin2 = 27;

// Define endstop pin assignments
const int xMinPin = 3;  // X-min endstop pin
const int yMinPin = 14; // Y-min endstop pin
const int zMinPin = 18; // Z-min endstop pin

// Temperature sensor pin assignments
const int hotendTempPin = A13; // Analog input pin for hotend temperature
const int heatedBedTempPin = A14; // Analog input pin for bed temperature

// Initialize stepper motors using AccelStepper
AccelStepper stepperX(AccelStepper::DRIVER, X_pin1, X_pin2);
AccelStepper stepperY(AccelStepper::DRIVER, Y_pin1, Y_pin2);
AccelStepper stepperZ(AccelStepper::DRIVER, Z_pin1, Z_pin2);
AccelStepper stepperE(AccelStepper::DRIVER, E_pin1, E_pin2);

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    // Setup stepper motors
    stepperX.setMaxSpeed(1000);
    stepperY.setMaxSpeed(1000);
    stepperZ.setMaxSpeed(100);
    stepperE.setMaxSpeed(1000);
    stepperX.setAcceleration(1000);
    stepperY.setAcceleration(1000);
    stepperZ.setAcceleration(100);
    stepperE.setAcceleration(1000);

    // Setup endstops
    pinMode(xMinPin, INPUT);
    pinMode(yMinPin, INPUT);
    pinMode(zMinPin, INPUT);

    // Additional setup code for temperature control, LCD, etc.
    // (Not included in this part)
}
```

This initial part sets up the basics: including necessary libraries, defining pin assignments, initializing stepper motors, and setting up the Arduino in the `setup()` function. The next parts will include the `loop()` function, G-code processing, endstop checking, and basic motion control. 

Please let me know when you're ready for the next part!

Continuing from where we left off, the next part of the firmware will focus on the main `loop()` function, the start of G-code processing, and basic motion control functions.

### Part 2: Main Loop, Basic G-Code Processing, and Motion Control

```cpp
void loop() {
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {
        String command = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
        processGCode(command);
    }
    checkEndstops();
    controlTemperature();
}

void processGCode(String command) {
    if (command.startsWith("G1")) {
        // Parse and execute G1 command for linear movement
        // Example: Extract X, Y, Z, E parameters
        // Convert them to steps and move the steppers
        // The actual parsing and movement logic will be complex and is not fully implemented here
    }
    // Additional G-code commands handling to be added...
}

void moveStepper(AccelStepper &stepper, long position) {
    stepper.moveTo(position);
    while (stepper.distanceToGo() != 0) {
        stepper.run();
    }
}

void checkEndstops() {
    if (digitalRead(xMinPin) == LOW) {
        stepperX.stop();
    }
    // Repeat for other axes
}

void controlTemperature() {
    // Temperature control logic
    // Implement PID control for hotend and heated bed
    // This section needs a detailed implementation for temperature management
}
```

In this part:

- The `loop()` function continuously checks for incoming G-code commands, monitors endstops, and controls the temperature.
- The `processGCode()` function begins the implementation for handling G-code commands. Here, it's set up to recognize a "G1" command, which typically represents a linear move. The detailed parsing of G-code and execution is complex and requires further implementation.
- The `moveStepper()` function is a basic implementation to move a stepper motor to a given position.
- The `checkEndstops()` function stops motor movement if an endstop is triggered. This is important for preventing the printer from moving beyond its physical limits.
- The `controlTemperature()` function is a placeholder for temperature control logic, such as using a PID algorithm for maintaining stable temperatures at the hotend and heated bed.

This is still a high-level outline, and each function requires more detailed implementation, especially for a fully functional and safe 3D printer. Let me know when you're ready for the next part!

Continuing with the development of our simplified 3D printer firmware, we'll now focus on adding more detail to G-code processing, particularly for handling different types of G-code commands, and expanding on temperature control. This part will also include placeholders for advanced features that need to be developed further.

### Part 3: Advanced G-Code Processing and Temperature Control

```cpp
// Function to extract numerical value from G-code command
float extractGCodeValue(String gCode, char key, float defaultValue) {
    int keyIndex = gCode.indexOf(key);
    if (keyIndex == -1) return defaultValue;
    
    int spaceIndex = gCode.indexOf(' ', keyIndex);
    if (spaceIndex == -1) spaceIndex = gCode.length();
    
    return gCode.substring(keyIndex + 1, spaceIndex).toFloat();
}

void processGCode(String command) {
    // Example: Handle linear movement (G1)
    if (command.startsWith("G1")) {
        float x = extractGCodeValue(command, 'X', -1);
        float y = extractGCodeValue(command, 'Y', -1);
        float z = extractGCodeValue(command, 'Z', -1);
        float e = extractGCodeValue(command, 'E', -1);

        // Convert XYZE values to steps and move the steppers
        // Note: This requires proper calibration and conversion logic
        // moveStepper(stepperX, xSteps); // Placeholder for movement logic
        // Additional movement logic for Y, Z, and E axes...
    }
    // Handle more G-code commands (G0 for rapid movement, G28 for homing, etc.)
    // Additional G-code commands...
}

void controlTemperature() {
    int currentHotendTemp = readTemperature(hotendTempPin); // Placeholder for temperature reading
    int currentBedTemp = readTemperature(heatedBedTempPin); // Placeholder for temperature reading

    // Implement PID control to maintain target temperatures
    // Example: adjustHeater(hotendHeaterPin, targetHotendTemp, currentHotendTemp);
    // adjustHeater(bedHeaterPin, targetBedTemp, currentBedTemp);
}

int readTemperature(int sensorPin) {
    // Read the analog value from the sensor
    int reading = analogRead(sensorPin);

    // Convert that reading into temperature
    // Note: Actual conversion will depend on the type of temperature sensor used
    int temperature = map(reading, 0, 1023, 0, 300); // Placeholder conversion

    return temperature;
}

void adjustHeater(int heaterPin, int targetTemp, int currentTemp) {
    // Implement heater control logic
    // Example: Simple on/off control (not recommended for actual use)
    if (currentTemp < targetTemp) {
        digitalWrite(heaterPin, HIGH);
    } else {
        digitalWrite(heaterPin, LOW);
    }
    // For actual use, a PID control algorithm should be implemented here
}
```

In this part:

- `extractGCodeValue()` function extracts numerical values associated with specific characters in a G-code command.
- Expanded `processGCode()` to handle linear movement (G1) with basic parsing of X, Y, Z, and E values. This function needs more comprehensive logic to handle a full range of G-code commands.
- `controlTemperature()` and `readTemperature()` functions provide a basic framework for temperature control and reading, but they need more sophisticated implementations, especially using PID control for precise temperature management.
- `adjustHeater()` is a placeholder function for controlling the heater based on the target and current temperatures. In actual firmware, this should be replaced with a PID control algorithm.

This concludes Part 3. Remember, this code is still quite basic and lacks the complexities and safety features required for a fully functional 3D printer firmware. Let me know if you need further assistance or the next part!

Continuing with the development of our basic 3D printer firmware, this part will focus on adding placeholders for advanced features such as endstop handling for homing, the beginning of an LCD user interface, and some fundamental safety checks. These elements are crucial for a more functional and user-friendly firmware, but please remember that these are still simplified and require significant expansion for real-world applications.

### Part 4: Advanced Endstop Handling, LCD Interface, and Safety Checks

```cpp
// Endstop handling for homing
void homeAxis(AccelStepper &stepper, int endstopPin) {
    // Move towards the endstop
    while (digitalRead(endstopPin) != LOW) {
        stepper.setSpeed(-50); // Move slowly towards endstop
        stepper.runSpeed();
    }
    stepper.stop(); // Stop the stepper once the endstop is hit
    stepper.setCurrentPosition(0); // Set this position as home (0)
    // Additional logic to move off the endstop slightly and re-approach for precision
}

// Placeholder for LCD user interface
void updateLCD() {
    // Update LCD with the current status of the printer
    // Example: current temperatures, print status, etc.
    // This requires an LCD library and proper initialization
}

// Basic safety checks
void safetyCheck() {
    // Example: Check for thermal runaway
    if (abs(targetHotendTemp - currentHotendTemp) > MAX_SAFE_TEMP_DIFFERENCE) {
        // Take action, such as shutting down the heater
    }
    // Additional safety checks...
}

// Main loop
void loop() {
    if (Serial.available() > 0) {
        String command = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');
        processGCode(command);
    }
    checkEndstops();
    controlTemperature();
    updateLCD();
    safetyCheck();
}
```

In this part:

- `homeAxis()` function provides a basic framework for homing an axis using endstops. This is a crucial feature for calibrating the printer's position at the start of a print or after an emergency stop.
- `updateLCD()` is a placeholder for updating an LCD display with the printer's status. This requires an LCD library and depends on the specific hardware used.
- `safetyCheck()` includes a basic safety check for thermal runaway, a critical feature for preventing dangerous overheating. This part of the firmware should be expanded to include other safety features as well.
- The main `loop()` function now also calls `updateLCD()` and `safetyCheck()`, integrating these new functionalities into the firmware's main operation cycle.

This framework sets the stage for a basic operational structure of a 3D printer firmware. However, building a complete, safe, and reliable firmware for a 3D printer is a highly complex task. It involves careful consideration of numerous factors, including precise motor control, advanced thermal management, comprehensive safety measures, and user-friendly interface design. This simplified version serves as an educational starting point but requires significant expansion and refinement for practical use.

Let me know if you need further assistance or more details on any specific part!
