### Organizing Archived Materials
- **Categorization and Indexing**:
  - Organize materials in a logical manner (e.g., by project phase, document type) and create an index or catalog for easy retrieval.
- **Metadata and Tagging**:
  - Include relevant metadata or tags with archived materials, such as project name, date, type of document, and key topics covered.

### Accessibility and Retrieval
- **Access Policies**:
  - Define who has access to the archived materials and under what circumstances they can be retrieved.
- **Retrieval Process**:
  - Document the process for retrieving archived materials, ensuring it’s straightforward and efficient.
