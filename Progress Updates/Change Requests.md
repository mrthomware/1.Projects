Managing change requests effectively is crucial in project management. Change requests may arise due to evolving requirements, unforeseen challenges, or stakeholder feedback. It's important to track these changes for impact analysis and decision-making. Here's a template for outlining Change Requests in a project:

### Change Requests

#### List of Change Requests
- **Change Request 1**:
  - **Description**: Provide a detailed explanation of what Change Request 1 entails. This should include the nature of the change, its origin (why it's being requested), and what aspects of the project it impacts.
  - **Status**: [Pending Review/Under Review/Approved/Rejected/Implemented] - Indicate the current status of the change request.

- **Change Request 2**:
  - **Description**: [Detail the specifics of Change Request 2, including the rationale behind it and the project components it affects.]
  - **Status**: [Current status of the request].

- **Additional Change Requests**: Continue listing any other change requests that have been submitted.
  - **Change Request 3**: [Description] - [Status]
  - **Change Request 4**: [Description] - [Status]

#### Impact Analysis
- For each change request, especially those under review or approved, conduct an impact analysis. This should cover:
  - **Scope Impact**: How the change affects the project scope.
  - **Timeline Impact**: The effect of the change on the project timeline.
  - **Budget Impact**: Financial implications of the change.
  - **Resource Impact**: How the change affects resource allocation and utilization.
  - **Risk Assessment**: Any new risks introduced by the change.

#### Decision Process
- **Review and Approval**: Outline the process for reviewing and approving change requests, including who is responsible for these decisions.
- **Criteria for Decision**: Detail the criteria used to evaluate and decide upon change requests.

#### Implementation and Tracking
- **Implementation Plan**: For approved changes, describe the plan for implementing the change, including any adjustments to the project plan, resources, and timeline.
- **Tracking of Changes**: Explain how implemented changes will be tracked and reported within the project management framework.

#### Communication
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Discuss how changes, especially significant ones, are communicated to stakeholders, including team members, sponsors, and clients.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that all change requests and their statuses, including documentation of decisions and impact analyses, are properly recorded for future reference.

By maintaining a detailed record of change requests and their statuses, the project team can manage alterations to the project scope and plan effectively, ensuring that the project adapts fluidly while staying aligned with its objectives.
