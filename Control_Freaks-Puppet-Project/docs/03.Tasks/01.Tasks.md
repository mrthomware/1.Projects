## Task Definition Guidelines

1. **Task Description**  
   Provide a clear, concise description of each task. It should be specific enough that team members understand what is required.

2. **Task Owner**  
   Assign a responsible individual for each task. This person is accountable for the completion of the task.

3. **Dependencies**  
   Identify any dependencies between tasks. Some tasks may need others to be completed before they can start.

4. **Duration**  
   Estimate how long each task will take to complete. This helps in scheduling and resource allocation.

5. **Start and End Dates**  
   Based on the duration and dependencies, determine the start and end dates for each task.

6. **Resources Required**  
   List the resources (such as personnel, equipment, materials) needed to complete each task.

7. **Priority Level**  
   Assign a priority level to each task. This helps in focusing on the most critical tasks, especially when resources are limited or there are conflicting demands.

8. **Progress Indicators**  
   Define how progress on the task will be measured and reported. This could include completion percentages, milestones reached, or deliverables produced.

9. **Risk Factors**  
   Identify any potential risks or challenges associated with each task and plan for how to mitigate them.

10. **Integration with Overall Project Goals**  
    Ensure that each task aligns with the overall project objectives and contributes to achieving the project goals.

11. **Flexibility for Adjustments**  
    Be prepared to adjust tasks as the project progresses, in response to changes in scope, resources, or other factors.

12. **Documentation and Tracking**  
    Maintain detailed records of tasks, including changes in scope, timelines, or resources, and regularly update the project plan and stakeholders.
