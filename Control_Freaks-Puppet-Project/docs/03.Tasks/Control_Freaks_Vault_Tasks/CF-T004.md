# Task: 3D Model Puppet Shell (Head & Body)

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T004
- **Description**: Create a detailed 3D model of the puppet's outer shell, including the head, torso, and mounting base. The model must accommodate internal servo mounts, wiring channels, access panels for maintenance, and modular component integration. This model will serve as the foundation for the animatronic skeleton and must be printable in segments compatible with existing 3D printers.
- **Assigned To**: CAD Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-08
- **End Date**: 2025-06-15
- **Status**: in progress
- **Progress Details**:
  - Base geometry and proportions finalized (as of 2025-06-09)
  - Mounting notches and access ports in development
  - Final shell slicing for printability scheduled for 2025-06-12
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Fusion 360 for design
  - Meshmixer for cleanup and export prep
  - Creality Ender 3 printer (build volume reference)
  - Digital calipers for measuring fit tolerances
- **Dependencies**:
  - Head servo bracket specs from Mechanical Team (CF-T003)
  - Control system module space allocation from Engineering Team (CF-T002)
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Balancing structural strength with lightweight design
  - Ensuring tool access during assembly without compromising external shape
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Establishes physical form and constraints for all internal systems
  - Guides all mechanical and electrical integration downstream
  - Enables prototype printing and assembly validation

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - FX team requested surface anchor points for skin attachment
  - Engineering requested optional internal panel for future PCB mounting
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Revised rear panel to include magnetic access door (update committed 2025-06-10)
