# Task: Eye and Eyelid Motion Assembly

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T008
- **Description**: Assemble and integrate the mechanical and actuation systems for eye rotation (left/right, up/down) and eyelid control (open/close, blink) using micro-servos and linkages. The assembly must be compact enough to fit inside the puppet head while maintaining smooth and realistic motion. Deliverables include mounting brackets, mechanical linkages, servo calibration scripts, and full system testing with the skin applied.
- **Assigned To**: Robotics Lead
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-18
- **End Date**: 2025-06-21
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Awaiting final bracket clearance from CAD Team (CF-T004)
  - Servo specs verified (MG90S confirmed)
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Micro servos (x4) for 2D eye movement and eyelid control
  - 3D-printed cradle mounts and linkages
  - Servo tester, Arduino control board
  - Puppet skull prototype with eye socket frames
- **Dependencies**:
  - Final shell internal space layout (CF-T004)
  - Control logic interface from Puppet Control System (CF-T002)
  - Servo bracket layout from Facial Mechanism (CF-T003)
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Avoiding servo chatter and linkage slack during rapid blinks
  - Ensuring left/right eyes move in sync with smooth travel
  - Accommodating motion range under silicone skin without drag
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Affects core puppet realism and expressiveness
  - Critical for interaction, audience engagement, and storytelling impact
  - One of the most visually sensitive subassemblies; must perform flawlessly under scrutiny

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - FX Team noted skin tension might resist eyelid closure; recommend preload testing
  - Consider upgrade path to magnetic eye retention system for quick swap in future puppets
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Bracket design updated to include adjustable eye height post-install
  - May revise eyelid linkage type from cable-pull to rigid bar if servo power permits
