# ⚠️ Risk Management – Control Freaks Vault

This Risk Management Plan addresses challenges across the three main project areas — **Controller Development**, **Puppet Development**, and **YouTube Channel Development** — considering the constraints of a **solo creator**.

---

## 🚨 Potential Risks

### 🔧 Controller Development

#### **Risk C1: Servo Hardware Failure or Limited Precision**
- **Description**: Low-cost servos (e.g., SG90, MG996R) may wear out quickly or jitter during slow-speed operations.
- **Impact**: May cause motion inaccuracies, misalignment with sound, or damage to 3D-printed mechanisms.

#### **Risk C2: Audio-Motion Synchronization Failures**
- **Description**: Microcontroller logic might fail to keep sub-50ms latency across cycles.
- **Impact**: Breaks immersion during puppet performance; may require redesign of script timing.

#### **Risk C3: Toolchain Incompatibility**
- **Description**: Hardware and software (Arduino IDE, Python, Obsidian automation) might have version mismatches or OS compatibility issues.
- **Impact**: Development slowdown, failed builds, or unstable integration between hardware/software.

### 🧱 Puppet Development

#### **Risk P1: Mechanical Misalignment or Design Fatigue**
- **Description**: Servo placement, joint tolerances, or plastic fatigue may cause unpredictable puppet behavior.
- **Impact**: Requires reprinting, redesigns, or affects visual realism during scenes.

#### **Risk P2: Material/Part Availability**
- **Description**: Delays in sourcing wires, joints, or servo mounts may cause development bottlenecks.
- **Impact**: Timeline delays and increased costs for fast-shipping or replacement components.

#### **Risk P3: Overengineering**
- **Description**: Designing for too many features (e.g., blinking, head tilt, complex expressions) in one build.
- **Impact**: Increased scope, complexity, and time required beyond a solo developer’s capacity.

### 🎥 YouTube Channel Development

#### **Risk Y1: Production Burnout**
- **Description**: Writing, animating, filming, editing, and publishing can be mentally and physically draining alone.
- **Impact**: Decreased quality or missed deadlines due to fatigue or creative blocks.

#### **Risk Y2: File Corruption or Data Loss**
- **Description**: Video or project files may be lost due to unsaved work, crashes, or hardware failure.
- **Impact**: Requires re-shooting or re-editing, causing significant delays.

#### **Risk Y3: Low Viewer Engagement**
- **Description**: Initial episodes may not attract intended audience or receive useful feedback.
- **Impact**: Reduced motivation, difficulty validating project direction or format.

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

| Risk ID | Strategy                                                                                     | Owner         | Timeline                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| C1      | Use quality-reviewed servos; stress-test before integration; keep 1-2 backup motors.         | Thomas Ware   | June 15–July 01, 2025           |
| C2      | Add debug timing logs; use audio-buffer alignment; optimize frame delay.                     | Thomas Ware   | July 01–July 10, 2025           |
| C3      | Lock development environments (`requirements.txt`, fixed board versions); test on known OS. | Thomas Ware   | June 12–June 25, 2025           |
| P1      | CAD simulation and tolerance checks; print test joints before full parts.                    | Thomas Ware   | July 03–July 10, 2025           |
| P2      | Order parts early; reuse salvaged or modular rig components.                                 | Thomas Ware   | Ongoing                         |
| P3      | Prioritize jaw/eye motion only for first puppet; backlog enhancements.                       | Thomas Ware   | July 10 scope checkpoint        |
| Y1      | Add 2-day buffer for rest; break down filming/editing into short, focused sprints.           | Thomas Ware   | July 25–Aug 01, 2025            |
| Y2      | Use autosave in Adobe; keep Git backups for script/assets; daily external backups.           | Thomas Ware   | July 20–Aug 05, 2025            |
| Y3      | Share pilot with niche communities (LinkedIn, Discord); adjust based on comments.            | Thomas Ware   | Aug 05–Aug 15, 2025             |

## 📊 Monitoring and Review

- **Weekly risk check-ins** using Obsidian's Task Log and Progress Tracker.
- **Status tagging system**:
  - `#risk/pending`
  - `#risk/active`
  - `#risk/mitigated`
- **Formal reviews** at key milestones:
  - Post-Controller Completion (July 02)
  - Post-Puppet Test (July 24)
  - After Video Publish (Aug 02)

## 🧠 Strategic Note

All risks are assessed through a **solo-creator lens**, with built-in pacing for mental health, budget-conscious prototyping, and iterative audience feedback. Risk tolerance is moderate — flexibility is prioritized over perfection.
