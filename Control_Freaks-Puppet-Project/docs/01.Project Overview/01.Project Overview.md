# ðŸŽ­ Project Overview â€“ Control Freaks Vault

## 1. Background and Purpose

The Control Freaks Vault is a solo-operated multimedia engineering project integrating **mechatronics**, **creative storytelling**, and **digital publishing**. It merges three development streams:

- **Controller Development**: Electronic systems and firmware for puppet control.
- **Puppet Development**: Mechanical shells, servo integration, and expressive motion systems.
- **YouTube Channel Development**: Media production showcasing animatronic storytelling.

The project leverages low-cost prototyping platforms (e.g., Arduino/ESP32), open-source CAD tools, and Obsidian for workflow management.

## 2. Project Objectives and Goals

- **Controller Dev Goal**:  
  Design and validate a low-latency servo controller with <50ms sync time â€“ *Target: July 2, 2025*

- **Puppet Dev Goal**:  
  Build and animate a physical puppet with synced jaw, eye, and facial movements â€“ *Target: July 24, 2025*

- **YouTube Dev Goal**:  
  Script, film, and upload a fully-automated demo episode â€“ *Target: August 2, 2025*

- **Vault Integration Goal**:  
  Automate motion/audio cue logs inside Obsidian â€“ *Target: August 10, 2025*
