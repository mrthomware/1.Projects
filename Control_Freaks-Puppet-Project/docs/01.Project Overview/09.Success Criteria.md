# ✅ Success Criteria – Control Freaks Vault

This section outlines measurable, attainable outcomes across the three integrated development areas: Controller Development, Puppet Development, and YouTube Channel Development.

---

## 🎮 1. Controller Development

### 📏 **Criteria: Audio-Motion Synchronization Accuracy**

- **Description**: Servo control scripts must trigger puppet movement within a 50ms window of pre-defined audio cues to ensure lifelike sync.

- **Measurement**: Review servo logs and timestamped audio markers from simulation or playback recordings.

- **Target**: ≤ **50ms average latency** across 3 test runs using recorded scripts and controller firmware.

---

## 🤖 2. Puppet Development

### 🧠 **Criteria: Motion Repeatability and Physical Integrity**

- **Description**: Puppet must execute a 10-step animation sequence consistently over five cycles without mechanical or servo failure.

- **Measurement**: Manual verification of motion ranges and durability checks over repeated sequences.

- **Target**: ≥ **95% accuracy** in motion reproduction with no hardware degradation across tests.

---

### 🔩 **Criteria: Complete Puppet Assembly and Functional Motion Range**

- **Description**: Final puppet should exhibit facial (jaw, eyes) and head motion range aligned with design intent.

- **Measurement**: Use checklists during functional testing to confirm all actuators operate through defined degrees of freedom.

- **Target**: All components **fully functional**, and system passes a scripted test with no critical errors.

---

## 🎥 3. YouTube Channel Development

### 🎬 **Criteria: Pilot Episode Completion and Audience Engagement**

- **Description**: A 3–5 minute YouTube video is published showing puppet performance and behind-the-scenes content.

- **Measurement**: Validate upload, and record viewer feedback/engagement.

- **Target**: **1 published video** + **5+ viewer comments** related to animation quality or project execution.

---

## 📂 4. Workflow Integration & Documentation

### 🧰 **Criteria: Vault-Embedded Task and Storyboard Systems**

- **Description**: Obsidian vault must house at least one storyboard canvas with script-triggered action links and Dataview-tagged tasks.

- **Measurement**: Usability test of task-driven automation and cross-referenced build notes.

- **Target**: ≥ **1 working storyboard canvas** + integration with controller scripts.

---

## 📦 5. Completion of Deliverables

- **Description**: Validate that all deliverables in `04.Key Deliverables.md` are completed per scope.

- **Measurement**: Manual check-off of physical components, firmware scripts, Obsidian automation, and YouTube episode.

- **Target**: **100% of defined deliverables completed** by **August 15, 2025**

## 🧭 Continuous Evaluation

| Checkpoint | Review Focus                                   | Date           |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Midpoint   | Functionality of controller & puppet movement  | July 18, 2025  |
| Final      | Total integration & audience-facing video      | August 15, 2025 |

### 🔄 Adjustment Protocol

- Weekly review of progress using Obsidian task lists.
- Timeline updates to accommodate unexpected delays.
- Scope changes logged directly in `03.Scope of Work.md`.
