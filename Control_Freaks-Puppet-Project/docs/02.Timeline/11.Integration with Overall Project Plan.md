## 🧩 Integration with Overall Project Plan – Control Freaks Vault

This section documents the consistency checks across the project timeline, budget estimates, resource allocations, and the risk mitigation framework to ensure unified execution and planning discipline.

---

### ✅ 1. Consistency Check Overview

**Objective:**  
Ensure that the Control Freaks puppet production plan aligns with supporting documents: the Budget Plan, Resource Allocation Sheet, and Risk Management Framework.

---

### 💰 2. Budget Consistency Check

**Purpose:**  
Confirm all tasks and milestones are within budget scope and funding allocations.

**Steps:**

1. **Review Budget Allocation**
   - Each milestone (e.g., T03 – 3D Printing, T05 – Electronics Procurement) has a corresponding budget line item in `Budget_Plan.md`.
   - Allocation matches material costs, license fees, and labor estimates.

2. **Identify Budget Variances**
   - T02 CAD duration slightly exceeded projection due to added rig complexity.
   - T11 (Video Editing) has added $30 for new SFX assets.

3. **Adjustments and Reconciliation**
   - Adjusted contingency buffer in the budget to absorb SFX asset purchase.
   - All task lines are now fully aligned with the revised budget.

**Outcome:**  
✅ Budget plan reconciled and matched to timeline and task list with no unresolved cost overruns.

### 🧑‍🔧 3. Resource Plan Consistency Check

**Purpose:**  
Ensure that required tools, personnel, and digital assets are allocated and available for all planned activities.

**Steps:**

1. **Resource Allocation Review**
   - Matched all `Resource_Allocation.md` entries to task IDs in `Tasks_and_Activities.md`.
   - CAD software, 3D printers, servo test kits, and sound booths are reserved.

2. **Resource Availability Verification**
   - Confirmed Prusa i3 MK3S+ availability post-2025-06-08.
   - Electronics components procured and stocked in lab.

3. **Adjustments**
   - No conflicts; shift in CAD deadline accommodated with updated printer reservation.

**Outcome:**  
✅ Resource plan aligned with execution timeline; no shortages anticipated.

---

### ⚠️ 4. Risk Management Plan Consistency Check

**Purpose:**  
Ensure all known risks are addressed and mitigated in the project schedule.

**Steps:**

1. **Risk Identification Cross-Check**
   - Key risks from `Risk_Management_Log.md` (e.g., servo failure, CAD print mismatch) are tagged in task planning.

2. **Mitigation Strategy Review**
   - T03 includes buffer for reprints; T06 includes alternate fallback script for basic motion demo.
   - Risk log cross-referenced in `Buffer_Time.md`.

3. **Adjustments**
   - Mid-project review point (2025-06-20) added to flag technical blockers.

**Outcome:**  
✅ All identified risks are addressed through timeline buffers, fallback plans, and milestone checkpoints.

---

### 🔁 5. Final Integration Review

**Purpose:**  
Complete consolidation and approval of all key documents supporting the execution plan.

**Steps:**

1. **Consolidated Review**
   - Milestones, task lists, budget, and risks now cross-linked via internal backlinks and tags in the Vault.
   - Timeline Gantt chart and Kanban board reflect updated dependencies and buffers.

2. **Stakeholder Approval**
   - Final review to be held on 2025-06-09.
   - Sign-off required from: Thomas Ware, Engineering Lead, Production Editor.

**Outcome:**  
✅ All documents reconciled and validated. Control Freaks project is ready to proceed with execution phase.

---

**Note**: Ongoing integration checks will be documented weekly via `Project_Management/Integration_Review_Log.md` and flagged in the sprint review log if changes arise.
