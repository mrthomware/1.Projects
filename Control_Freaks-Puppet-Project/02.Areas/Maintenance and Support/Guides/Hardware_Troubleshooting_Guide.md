# **Hardware Troubleshooting Guide**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Overview**
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to troubleshoot common hardware issues encountered during the **3D Puppet Design** project, particularly in prototyping and testing phases.

## **2. Troubleshooting Steps**

### **A. 3D Printer Issues**
| **Problem**                | **Possible Cause**                            | **Solution**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Printer not starting       | Power supply issue or connection fault        | Check power cable and ensure outlet functionality.                         |
| Filament not extruding     | Clogged nozzle or incorrect filament feed     | Clean the nozzle and verify filament path is clear.                        |
| Layer shifting during print| Loose belts or misaligned bed                 | Tighten belts and recalibrate the printer bed.                             |

### **B. Physical Prototype Assembly**
| **Problem**                | **Possible Cause**                            | **Solution**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Joints are too loose       | Incorrect assembly or weak materials          | Reinforce joints with stronger materials or adjust assembly technique.     |
| Parts not fitting          | Printing inaccuracies or scaling issues       | Verify model dimensions and reprint if necessary.                         |
| Fragile components         | Inadequate material strength                  | Use a higher-quality or more durable filament (e.g., PETG, ABS).           |

### **C. Electronics and Sensors**
| **Problem**                | **Possible Cause**                            | **Solution**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sensor not responding      | Faulty wiring or incompatible components      | Recheck wiring and confirm compatibility with the control board.           |
| Power fluctuations         | Insufficient power supply                     | Use a stable power source or replace the power adapter.                    |
| Intermittent connectivity  | Loose connections or interference             | Secure all connections and minimize nearby electronic noise.               |

## **3. Best Practices for Troubleshooting**
1. **Document Issues:**
   - Maintain a log of problems, attempted solutions, and outcomes.
2. **Systematic Testing:**
   - Test one variable at a time to isolate the root cause of the issue.
3. **Consult Manuals:**
   - Refer to equipment manuals for manufacturer-recommended troubleshooting steps.
4. **Engage Specialists:**
   - For complex issues, consult team members with relevant expertise or external technicians.
