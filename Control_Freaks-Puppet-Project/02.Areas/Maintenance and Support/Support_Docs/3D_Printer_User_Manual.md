# **3D Printer User Manual**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Overview**
This user manual provides detailed instructions for setting up, operating, and maintaining the 3D printer used in the **3D Puppet Design** project. It aims to ensure efficient operation and consistent print quality.

---

## **2. Printer Setup**

### **A. Unboxing and Assembly**
1. Remove all components from the packaging.
2. Assemble the printer frame using the provided screws and tools.
3. Attach the extruder, bed, and control screen following the manufacturer’s guide.

### **B. Initial Calibration**
1. **Level the Bed:**
   - Use the leveling knobs to ensure the print bed is perfectly flat.
   - Place a sheet of paper between the nozzle and the bed; adjust until you feel slight resistance.
2. **Load Filament:**
   - Preheat the nozzle to the recommended temperature for your filament type.
   - Insert the filament into the extruder until it flows smoothly from the nozzle.

## **3. Printing Guidelines**

### **A. Preparing the Model**
1. Import your 3D model file (STL/OBJ) into slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
2. Adjust print settings:
   - Layer height: 0.1–0.2 mm for detailed prints.
   - Print speed: 50–60 mm/s for standard prints.
   - Infill density: 20–30% for prototypes; higher for structural components.
3. Generate the G-code and save it to an SD card or USB drive.

### **B. Starting the Print**
1. Insert the SD card/USB drive into the printer.
2. Select the file from the control panel and start the print.
3. Monitor the first few layers to ensure proper adhesion.

## **4. Maintenance and Troubleshooting**

### **A. Routine Maintenance**
1. **Clean the Nozzle:**
   - Use a brass wire brush to remove debris.
   - Perform a cold pull to clear any clogs.
2. **Lubricate Moving Parts:**
   - Apply a small amount of lubricant to the Z-axis screws and rails.
3. **Inspect Belts and Gears:**
   - Check for wear and adjust tension as needed.

### **B. Common Issues**
| **Issue**                | **Possible Cause**              | **Solution**                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Poor first layer adhesion| Unleveled bed or dirty surface | Re-level the bed and clean it with isopropyl alcohol. |
| Stringing or blobs       | Incorrect retraction settings   | Adjust retraction distance and speed in the slicer. |
| Layer shifting           | Loose belts or misaligned bed  | Tighten belts and recalibrate the bed.        |

## **5. Safety Precautions**
1. Do not leave the printer unattended during operation.
2. Use the printer in a well-ventilated area.
3. Avoid touching the nozzle or bed while they are hot.
