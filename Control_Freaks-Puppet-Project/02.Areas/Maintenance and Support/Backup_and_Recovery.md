# **Backup and Recovery Guide**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Overview**
This guide outlines the backup and recovery protocols for the **3D Puppet Design** project. It ensures the security and integrity of project files, minimizing data loss and downtime.

---

## **2. Backup Procedures**

### **A. File Organization**
1. **Use a Central Repository:**
   - Store all project files in a shared Google Drive folder.
   - Maintain a consistent folder structure (e.g., Design, Animation, Prototyping).
2. **Version Control:**
   - Use version-controlled filenames (e.g., `Model_v1.blend`, `Model_v2.blend`).
   - Archive older versions in a subfolder named `Archive`.

### **B. Backup Frequency**
1. **Daily Backups:**
   - Automatically sync changes to Google Drive at the end of each day.
2. **Weekly Backups:**
   - Create a full project backup and store it in an external hard drive or cloud storage.

### **C. Backup Tools**
1. **Google Drive:** Real-time file syncing and storage.
2. **External Hard Drives:** Additional layer of redundancy for critical files.
3. **Backup Software:** Use tools like Acronis or Carbonite for automated backups.

## **3. Recovery Procedures**

### **A. Immediate Recovery**
1. Locate the most recent backup from Google Drive or external storage.
2. Restore the required files or folders to their original locations.
3. Verify file integrity and test functionality.

### **B. Escalation Protocol**
1. **Team-Level Recovery:**
   - Notify the Project Manager of the issue.
   - Assign team members to assist in locating and restoring backups.
2. **Specialist Involvement:**
   - Engage IT support for severe data loss or hardware failure.

---

## **4. Best Practices**
1. **Document All Backups:**
   - Maintain a log of backup dates, locations, and responsible team members.
2. **Test Recovery Process:**
   - Periodically test the recovery process to ensure readiness.
3. **Access Management:**
   - Restrict backup access to authorized personnel to maintain data security.
