# **Guidelines: Design Review**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Purpose**
These guidelines outline the process for conducting design reviews in the **3D Puppet Design** project. The objective is to ensure all designs meet creative and technical requirements while aligning with stakeholder expectations.

---

## **2. Design Review Criteria**

### **A. Artistic Quality**
1. **Theme Consistency:**
   - Verify that designs adhere to the "Mad Scientist" theme.
   - Ensure props, color palettes, and overall aesthetics are cohesive.
2. **Detail Level:**
   - Confirm sufficient detail in character features and props without clutter.
   - Ensure designs maintain balance between simplicity and complexity.

### **B. Functional Requirements**
1. **Proportions:**
   - Validate that proportions support the intended functionality and animation.
   - Check that joints and articulation points are well-placed.
2. **Prototyping Feasibility:**
   - Ensure designs can transition smoothly into 3D modeling and physical prototyping.
   - Verify material selections and their suitability for production.

### **C. Technical Compatibility**
1. **3D Workflow Alignment:**
   - Confirm that designs are optimized for 3D modeling.
   - Check for unnecessary complexity that might hinder rigging or texturing.
2. **Material Definitions:**
   - Ensure materials are clearly defined and tested for physical and digital use.

### **D. Stakeholder Input**
1. **Feedback Integration:**
   - Confirm that previous feedback has been addressed adequately.
   - Highlight unresolved issues requiring further input.
2. **Approval Status:**
   - Ensure designs are ready for stakeholder sign-off.

## **3. Review Process**

### **A. Pre-Review Preparation**
1. Compile all design assets for review (e.g., mood boards, sketches, models).
2. Distribute assets and agenda to reviewers at least 48 hours before the session.
3. Identify specific aspects requiring feedback or decisions.

### **B. Review Session**
1. **Introduction:**
   - Outline session objectives and provide context for the designs.
2. **Presentation:**
   - Walk through each design, highlighting features and decisions.
3. **Feedback Collection:**
   - Facilitate open discussion and document actionable feedback.

### **C. Post-Review Actions**
1. Summarize feedback and distribute a follow-up document.
2. Implement changes based on agreed updates.
3. Schedule additional reviews if necessary.

## **4. Tools and Resources**
- **Procreate/Photoshop:** For sketching and mood board creation.
- **Blender:** For visualizing designs in 3D.
- **Slack:** For real-time feedback and collaboration.

---

## **5. Best Practices**
1. **Encourage Collaboration:**
   - Include diverse perspectives in the review process.
2. **Iterate Effectively:**
   - Apply feedback thoughtfully without deviating from project goals.
3. **Document Decisions:**
   - Maintain a clear record of changes and approvals for transparency.
