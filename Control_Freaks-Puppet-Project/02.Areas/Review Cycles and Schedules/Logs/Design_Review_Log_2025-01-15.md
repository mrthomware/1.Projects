| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer A           | The "Mad Scientist" theme needs more prominent props in the background.    | Add thematic props like oversized test tubes and bubbling vials. | In Progress       |
| Reviewer B           | The color palette feels too muted; brighter tones are recommended.          | Revise color schemes to incorporate vibrant colors. | Pending           |

### **B. Proportions and Anatomy**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer C           | Puppetâ€™s head-to-body ratio appears off.                                    | Adjust proportions for better expressiveness.   | In Progress       |
| Reviewer B           | Hands are too small for functional articulation.                            | Refine hand proportions for improved balance.   | Not Started       |

### **C. Material Selection**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer A           | Texture details on goggles need to reflect a metallic appearance.          | Update materials to include metallic finishes.  | Pending Review    |
| Reviewer C           | The lab coat material should appear semi-gloss for a polished look.         | Adjust material properties accordingly.         | Not Started       |
