## **2. Feedback Details**

### **A. General Animation**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer A           | Transitions between gestures feel abrupt.                                   | Refine keyframe interpolation for smoother transitions. | In Progress       |
| Reviewer B           | Certain movements lack personality and dynamic range.                      | Add exaggerated motions to emphasize character traits. | Pending Review    |

### **B. Facial Animation**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer C           | Expressions need more variety during dialogue scenes.                      | Introduce subtle eyebrow and mouth movements for nuance. | Not Started       |
| Reviewer A           | Lip-sync is slightly out of sync with audio.                               | Adjust timing to improve accuracy.              | Pending           |

### **C. Technical Aspects**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Technical Lead       | Clipping issues observed with props during fast movements.                 | Adjust collision detection and physics settings. | In Progress       |
| Animation Lead       | Hair physics appear unnatural in high-speed sequences.                     | Refine physics simulations for better realism.  | Pending Review    |

## **3. Key Observations**
- Stakeholders appreciated the overall direction but emphasized the need for more polished transitions and expressions.
- Physics simulations require additional attention to improve realism.
- Exaggerated motions align well with the puppetâ€™s whimsical theme.

## **4. Next Steps**
1. Refine transitions and improve the dynamic range of motions by [Insert Date].
2. Enhance facial animations with nuanced expressions by [Insert Date].
3. Resolve physics-related issues in props and hair simulations by [Insert Date].
