## **2. Feedback Entries**

### **A. Concept Development**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder A       | Emphasize whimsical elements in the design.                                  | Add vibrant props and playful details.          | In Progress       |
| [Insert Date]  | Design Team         | Include more texture references for prototyping.                             | Compile material samples for review.            | Completed         |

### **B. 3D Modeling**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Animation Lead      | Refine proportions for smoother animation.                                   | Adjust head-to-body ratio and joint alignment.  | In Progress       |
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder B       | Simplify textures for clarity in animations.                                 | Reduce texture complexity and optimize UV maps. | Pending           |

### **C. Animation**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Reviewer C          | Improve transitions between gestures for smoother flow.                      | Refine keyframe interpolation.                  | Pending Review    |
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder A       | Enhance secondary motion for props and accessories.                          | Add dynamic simulations to improve realism.     | Not Started       |

---

## **3. Summary of Actions**
1. Refine designs to enhance whimsical elements and material selections.
2. Adjust 3D model proportions and simplify textures for improved animation readiness.
3. Focus on refining gesture transitions and adding secondary motions in animations.

---

## **4. Notes and Observations**
- Stakeholders consistently emphasize the importance of aligning visuals with the "Mad Scientist" theme.
- Collaboration between the design, modeling, and animation teams is critical to implementing feedback effectively.
