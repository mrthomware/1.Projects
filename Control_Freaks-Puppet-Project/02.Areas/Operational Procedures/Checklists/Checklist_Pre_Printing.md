# **Checklist: Pre-Printing**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Overview**
This checklist ensures all necessary steps are completed before initiating the 3D printing process for the **3D Puppet Design** project. Proper preparation minimizes errors and material waste.

## **2. Pre-Printing Checklist**

### **A. File Preparation**
1. **Model Validation:**
   - Ensure the 3D model has no non-manifold geometry or overlapping faces.
   - Verify watertight integrity of the model.
2. **Scaling:**
   - Confirm the model is scaled to the correct dimensions.
   - Double-check unit settings (e.g., millimeters, inches).
3. **Orientation:**
   - Optimize the modelâ€™s orientation to minimize support material usage.
   - Ensure critical surfaces are facing upwards for better quality.
4. **Export Format:**
   - Save the file in the required format (e.g., `.STL`, `.OBJ`).

### **B. Printer Setup**
1. **Material Check:**
   - Confirm the correct filament type is loaded (e.g., PLA, ABS, PETG).
   - Ensure filament spool has sufficient material for the print.
2. **Printer Calibration:**
   - Level the print bed.
   - Check nozzle and bed temperatures for the chosen material.
   - Perform a nozzle cleaning if necessary.
3. **Test Print:**
   - Run a small calibration print to verify setup accuracy.

### **C. Slicing Settings**
1. **Layer Height:**
   - Adjust layer height based on desired quality (e.g., 0.1mm for high detail).
2. **Infill Density:**
   - Set appropriate infill percentage (e.g., 20% for standard prints).
3. **Supports and Rafts:**
   - Enable supports for overhangs and complex geometries.
   - Use rafts if additional bed adhesion is needed.

### **D. Final Checks**
1. **Preview Slices:**
   - Inspect slicing previews for errors or unexpected gaps.
   - Verify estimated print time and material usage.
2. **Environment:**
   - Ensure the printing environment is free from drafts and temperature fluctuations.

## **3. Notes and Best Practices**
- Always double-check printer settings before starting a print.
- Keep spare filaments and nozzles readily available to avoid delays.
- Document any issues encountered during the process for future reference.
