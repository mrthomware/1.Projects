# **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): 3D Modeling**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Purpose**
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) defines the workflow and best practices for creating and refining 3D models in the **3D Puppet Design** project. The goal is to ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency throughout the modeling process.

---

## **2. Scope**
This SOP applies to all team members involved in 3D modeling, covering software setup, modeling techniques, and quality checks.

---

## **3. Pre-Modeling Preparation**
1. **Gather References:**
   - Compile sketches, mood boards, and stakeholder feedback.
   - Ensure references align with the "Mad Scientist" theme.
2. **Software Setup:**
   - Open Blender or the designated modeling software.
   - Confirm system compatibility and update software to the latest version.
3. **File Structure:**
   - Save project files in an organized folder structure (e.g., `Models > Drafts > Final`).
   - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `Puppet_Model_v1.blend`).

## **4. Modeling Process**

### **A. Base Mesh Creation**
1. **Start with Simple Shapes:**
   - Use primitives (e.g., cubes, spheres) to create the basic structure.
2. **Maintain Proportions:**
   - Reference design sketches to ensure anatomical accuracy.
3. **Check Topology:**
   - Use quads wherever possible for smoother deformations.

### **B. Adding Details**
1. **Sculpt Features:**
   - Use the sculpting tools to refine facial features, clothing folds, and other details.
2. **Optimize Geometry:**
   - Retopologize high-poly models for animation readiness.
3. **Apply Modifiers:**
   - Use Mirror and Subdivision Surface modifiers to streamline the process.

### **C. Texture Preparation**
1. **UV Unwrapping:**
   - Ensure clean and distortion-free UV maps for accurate texturing.
2. **Bake Maps:**
   - Create normal, ambient occlusion, and roughness maps as needed.
3. **Test Materials:**
   - Assign basic shaders to preview how textures will appear.

---

## **5. Quality Assurance**
1. **Visual Check:**
   - Inspect the model for geometric errors, such as non-manifold edges or flipped normals.
2. **Scale Validation:**
   - Confirm that the model is to scale and aligns with project specifications.
3. **Animation Testing:**
   - Apply basic rigging to test articulation and deformation.

---

## **6. Post-Modeling Steps**
1. **Save Incrementally:**
   - Save versions of the model at critical stages for reference.
2. **Review with Team:**
   - Present the model for peer and stakeholder feedback.
3. **Finalize for Next Phase:**
   - Ensure the model is ready for rigging and animation.

---

## **7. Best Practices**
1. **Maintain Clean Topology:**
   - Use quads and avoid unnecessary edge loops to simplify rigging and texturing.
2. **Document Progress:**
   - Record decisions and changes for future reference.
3. **Backup Files:**
   - Save backups regularly to prevent data loss.
