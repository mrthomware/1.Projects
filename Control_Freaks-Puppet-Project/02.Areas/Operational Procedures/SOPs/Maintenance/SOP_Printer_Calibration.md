# **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): Printer Calibration**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Purpose**
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the steps to calibrate 3D printers for the **3D Puppet Design** project. Proper calibration ensures high-quality prints and minimizes material waste.

---

## **2. Scope**
This SOP applies to all team members responsible for operating and maintaining 3D printers used in the project.

## **3. Calibration Steps**

### **A. Initial Setup**
1. **Check Printer Environment:**
   - Ensure the printer is on a stable, vibration-free surface.
   - Maintain a room temperature between 20–25°C (68–77°F).
2. **Inspect Printer Components:**
   - Check for loose belts, screws, and connections.
   - Clean the nozzle and bed to remove residue.

### **B. Bed Leveling**
1. **Automatic Bed Leveling (if available):**
   - Run the auto-leveling feature via the printer’s interface.
2. **Manual Bed Leveling:**
   - Use a leveling card or standard paper.
   - Adjust the bed screws until there’s slight resistance when sliding the card under the nozzle.
3. **Verify Consistency:**
   - Check multiple points across the bed for uniform spacing.

### **C. Extruder Calibration**
1. **Measure Filament Feed:**
   - Mark 100mm of filament and extrude.
   - Measure the actual length extruded to ensure accuracy.
2. **Adjust E-Steps:**
   - Update the printer’s firmware settings based on the extrusion measurement.

### **D. Temperature Calibration**
1. **Test Nozzle Temperature:**
   - Print a temperature tower to identify the optimal setting for the filament.
2. **Test Bed Temperature:**
   - Adjust based on the filament type (e.g., PLA: 60°C, ABS: 100°C).

### **E. Test Print**
1. **Load Calibration File:**
   - Use a test file such as a 20mm cube or Benchy model.
2. **Inspect Print Quality:**
   - Check for stringing, warping, and layer adhesion.
   - Adjust settings as needed to resolve issues.

## **4. Maintenance Tips**
1. **Regular Cleaning:**
   - Clean the nozzle and bed after every print session.
2. **Update Firmware:**
   - Check for updates monthly to ensure compatibility and performance.
3. **Monitor Consumables:**
   - Keep filament dry and check for signs of wear on belts and nozzles.

---

## **5. Documentation and Logging**
- Record calibration results, including optimal temperature, e-steps, and test print observations.
- Maintain a log of any hardware replacements or adjustments made during calibration.
