## Managing References

### Organized Documentation

- **Filing System**:  
  References are stored under `/Resources/References/` using PARA-aligned naming conventions. Subfolders exist by type (`/Charter/`, `/Financial/`, `/Technical/`, etc.). Files include YAML headers and version suffixes.

### Accessibility

- **Access Provision**:  
  Obsidian Vault files are locally stored and versioned with Git. Password-protected PDFs are saved in a secure cloud folder. Essential files are synced via Obsidian Sync for mobile availability.

### Version Control

- **Versioning System**:  
  Semantic versioning is used in all document filenames. Git tracks all markdown files. PDF revisions include timestamps and changelogs in embedded metadata.

### Citation and Attribution

- **Citation Guidelines**:  
  APA-style citations for external documents. Internal references use double-bracket wiki links. Cited works are listed in the `[[Reference Index]]` with backlinks to associated notes.

### Confidentiality and Security

- **Confidentiality Measures**:  
  Sensitive files (e.g., grant awards, contracts) are encrypted with 256-bit AES in ZIP archives. Private repositories on GitHub use SSH authentication. File access is limited by local permissions.

### Regular Review and Update

- **Update Schedule**:  
  Reference updates are scheduled monthly or post-milestone. Updates are tracked in a `[[Reference Maintenance Log]]`. Obsolete files are moved to `/Archives/References/`.

### Integration with Project Tools

- **Integration Methods**:  
  All major references are linked within task notes and milestone plans. Gantt and Kanban views include reference access via embedded links. Vault plugins allow file previews inline.

### Training and Orientation

- **Training Plan**:  
  The `[[Reference Access Guide]]` document explains structure, security, and update procedures. Future collaborators will receive orientation walkthroughs.

### Audit and Compliance

- **Audit Readiness**:  
  A duplicate copy of all grant-related and financial references is stored in `/Archives/Funding Compliance/2025`. All documents maintain metadata and version history.

### Archiving

- **Archiving Process**:  
  On project completion, documents are moved into an archive with a `status: archived` YAML tag. Archived references are zipped and stored in `/Archives/References/Control Freaks/`.
