# Industry Standards and Best Practices

- **Standards Used**: [List relevant industry standards and guidelines]

---
Maintaining a clear record of industry standards and best practices followed in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** is crucial for ensuring quality, safety, regulatory compliance, and process efficiency. The following structure outlines the standards and practices actively referenced in the project:

## Industry Standards and Best Practices for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Industry Standards

- **CSA Z432-16 ‚Äì Safeguarding of Machinery**  
  - **Description**: Specifies safety requirements for the design, installation, and use of industrial machines and automation setups.  
  - **Application in Project**: Applied during hardware setup in the animatronic controller system to ensure operator safety when testing servos and power systems.

- **ISO 9001:2015 ‚Äì Quality Management Systems**  
  - **Description**: International standard focused on quality assurance through structured process control and documentation.  
  - **Application in Project**: Used to define documentation structure, issue tracking, and internal reviews during firmware testing and puppet movement calibration.

- **IEEE 802.3 ‚Äì Ethernet Standard**  
  - **Description**: Defines physical layer and data link layer's media access control (MAC) of wired Ethernet.  
  - **Application in Project**: Used during controller-to-computer data communication setup for telemetry logging.

- **ANSI/ESD S20.20 ‚Äì Electrostatic Discharge Control**  
  - **Description**: Best practice standard for controlling ESD in sensitive electronics environments.  
  - **Application in Project**: Implemented in the controller assembly station to protect microcontrollers and H-bridge circuits during soldering and handling.

### Best Practices

- **Agile-inspired Weekly Iteration Logs**  
  - **Description**: Apply iterative development cycles with frequent review and adaptation.  
  - **Implementation in Project**: Reflected in the `[Task Updates]` section and Kanban flow for continuous improvement and short feedback loops.

- **Version-Controlled Obsidian Vaults**  
  - **Description**: Maintain all documentation in markdown format under Git version control.  
  - **Implementation in Project**: Enhances traceability and ensures controlled document evolution during prototyping and testing.

- **Fail-Fast Testing Strategy**  
  - **Description**: Rapidly validate or reject component functionality during development to minimize downstream waste.  
  - **Implementation in Project**: Applied during servo response and PCB smoke-test phases.

- **Lean Documentation**  
  - **Description**: Maintain only essential, living documents that are updated regularly.  
  - **Implementation in Project**: All project docs use YAML headers, tracked updates, and are housed under `/Resources/References/`.

---

### Compliance and Documentation

- **Compliance Checks**  
  - Compliance is reviewed biweekly using a checklist stored in `[[Compliance/ControlFreaks_SafetyChecklist.md]]`  
  - Each development phase must pass minimum standard checks before progression.

- **Documented Evidence**  
  - All standards, checklists, and applied procedures are logged under:  
    - `/Compliance/`
    - `/Technical_Notes/Standards_Applied.md`
    - `/Audit/Audit_Readiness_Log.md`

---

### Continuous Improvement

- **Updates and Evolving Standards**  
  - Standards tracked through Google Alerts and industry mailing lists (e.g., IEEE Robotics & Automation Society).  
  - Updates reviewed during monthly project reviews.

- **Feedback and Adjustments**  
  - Review meetings and retrospectives logged in `[[Meeting Summaries]]` include best practice effectiveness and improvement suggestions.

---

### Training and Awareness

- **Team Training on Standards**  
  - Standards orientation conducted using `[[Training/Standard_Overview_Slides_June2025.pdf]]`.  
  - Module includes safety, QA, and ESD protocols.

- **Awareness Sessions on Best Practices**  
  - Weekly design reviews include a ‚ÄúLessons Shared‚Äù segment focused on reinforcing best practices.

---

Documenting industry standards and best practices in this manner ensures the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** remains aligned with quality expectations, enhances cross-functional learning, and builds a scalable knowledge base for future automation and animatronics projects.
