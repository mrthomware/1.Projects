## Research and Studies for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Research Studies

- **Study 1: "PWM Signal Integrity in Low-Cost Microcontrollers"**  
  - **Summary**: Explores jitter behavior in PWM outputs across multiple microcontroller families under variable loads. Highlights the need for buffered servo signal processing in animation applications.  
  - **Relevance to Project**: Provided critical insight into the servo twitching issues encountered during audio-synced motion prototyping. Led to the selection of external PWM drivers.  
  - **Document Reference**: `[[Research/Electronics/PWM_Stability_MCU_Benchmark_Study.pdf]]`

- **Study 2: "Facial Animation Timing from Voice Profiles"**  
  - **Summary**: An academic study examining the temporal alignment between speech and expected facial movement cues in puppet-like avatars.  
  - **Relevance to Project**: Helped define latency tolerances for lip sync accuracy in the Audio Servo Sync module.  
  - **Document Reference**: `[[Research/Animation/Voice-to-Motion_Timing_Study.pdf]]`

### Surveys

- **Survey 1: "Viewer Response to Puppet Realism in YouTube Content"**  
  - **Scope and Participants**: Conducted with 58 viewers aged 16‚Äì35 on perception of believability, charm, and uncanny reactions in animated puppet faces.  
  - **Key Insights**:
    - Viewers preferred imperfect but expressive motion over perfect mechanical synchronization.
    - Rapid eye movement was rated as "more lifelike" but needed smoothing for likability.  
  - **Document Reference**: `[[Research/User_Studies/Puppet_Likeness_Survey_2024.xlsx]]`

### External Analyses

- **Analysis 1: "Actuator Market Trends 2023‚Äì2028"**  
  - **Content Overview**: Industrial analysis of micro servo availability, pricing fluctuations, and counterfeit frequency in hobbyist markets.  
  - **Implications for Project**: Affected bulk purchasing strategy for servos and emphasized the need for reliability testing of parts from different vendors.  
  - **Document Reference**: `[[Research/Market/Servo_Trend_Analysis_2023.pdf]]`

- **Analysis 2: "Children‚Äôs Media and Puppet Engagement"**  
  - **Content Overview**: Media engagement study tracking how children respond to various puppet archetypes in modern digital content.  
  - **Implications for Project**: Informed character design choices for Control Freaks episodes and guided scripting approach.  
  - **Document Reference**: `[[Research/Content/Puppet_Engagement_Youth_Study.pdf]]`
