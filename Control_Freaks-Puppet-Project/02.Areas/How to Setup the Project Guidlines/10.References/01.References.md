## Managing References

### Organized Documentation

- **Filing System**:
  - All reference materials are stored in the `/Resources/References/` folder inside the Control Freaks Vault, with subfolders by category and file naming convention: `type-YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

### Accessibility

- **Access Provision**:
  - Documents stored in Obsidian Vault synced with GitHub private repo. Project collaborators have contributor-level access.

### Version Control

- **Versioning System**:
  - Git used for tracking changes to markdown references. Updates include changelog entries and datestamps in YAML headers.

### Citation and Attribution

- **Citation Guidelines**:
  - Internal documents follow markdown links.
  - External studies use APA-style inline references with footnotes as needed.

### Confidentiality and Security

- **Confidentiality Measures**:
  - Financial and stakeholder documents marked `confidential: true` in YAML and stored in encrypted subfolder `/Resources/Private_Records/`.

### Regular Review and Update

- **Update Schedule**:
  - Reference reviews scheduled every 30 days.
  - Triggered updates after each major project milestone.

### Integration with Project Tools

- **Integration Methods**:
  - References embedded in Obsidian task notes via backlinks.
  - Cross-linked with PARA task documents using Dataview.

### Training and Orientation

- **Training Plan**:
  - Orientation doc included in `/Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/00_Intro/`
  - Walkthrough guide provided during initial collaborator onboarding.

### Audit and Compliance

- **Audit Readiness**:
  - Reference index maintained in `Resources/References/_Index.md`.
  - All financial and legal references labeled and versioned.

### Archiving

- **Archiving Process**:
  - Upon project phase completion, references are zipped and stored under `/Archives/Control Freaks Puppet Project - References YYYY-MM-DD.zip`.
  - Read-only versions preserved in Obsidian.
