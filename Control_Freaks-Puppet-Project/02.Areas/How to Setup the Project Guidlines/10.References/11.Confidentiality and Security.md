# Confidentiality and Security

- **Confidentiality Measures**: Security measures for sensitive documents.

---
Ensuring confidentiality and security of sensitive documents in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** is essential for protecting proprietary designs, intellectual property, contributor identities, and strategic content pipelines. Below is the structured system used to enforce document security and data confidentiality.

---

## Confidentiality and Security Measures for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Identifying Sensitive Documents

- **Classification of Documents**:
  - Documents classified as *sensitive* include:
    - Proprietary servo control schematics
    - Firmware source code
    - Budget and funding spreadsheets
    - YouTube production planning
    - Stakeholder meeting transcripts
  - These are tagged in Obsidian with `#confidential` and stored in restricted subdirectories.

- **Marking and Labeling**:
  - All sensitive documents begin with the YAML field `confidential: true`.
  - Vault uses colored icons and folder flags for visual cues.

---

### Access Control

- **Restricted Access**:
  - Sensitive folders are stored locally in a BitLocker-encrypted partition.
  - Only Thomas Ware has full access; all external collaborators are issued read-only, time-limited links to sanitized versions when required.

- **User Authentication**:
  - GitHub access to private repositories is protected by SSH key authentication and 2FA.
  - Password managers (e.g., Bitwarden) are used to secure logins to vault sync services.

---

### Digital Security Measures

- **Encryption**:
  - Encrypted ZIP archives are used for backups containing sensitive documents.
  - Data-at-rest is secured via full-disk encryption on both development laptops and backup drives.

- **Secure Storage Solutions**:
  - Cloud storage is hosted on Nextcloud with E2EE enabled.
  - Sync only occurs between trusted devices with verified GPG keypairs.

---

### Physical Document Security

- **Secure Storage**:
  - Printed documents (schematics, notes) are stored in a fireproof lockbox at the project workspace.
  - All notes are digitized and removed from shared desks at end of work session.

- **Document Handling Protocols**:
  - No sensitive prints are made on public or shared printers.
  - Shredding is mandatory for disposal of all physical drafts or unneeded confidential notes.

---

### Data Transfer and Sharing

- **Secure Transfer Methods**:
  - Transfers are done using encrypted ProtonDrive links or encrypted USB sticks.
  - Large binaries (e.g., CAD exports) are transferred via SSH with GPG-signed confirmation receipts.

- **Sharing Protocols**:
  - Every document shared externally requires a record in the `[[Access Log.md]]` including purpose, recipient, and file hash.

---

### Regular Security Audits

- **Audit Schedule**:
  - Confidentiality compliance is reviewed every quarter or before external demos.
  - Security sweep checklist is maintained in `[[Security_Audit_Quarterly.md]]`.

- **Audit Documentation**:
  - Reports are appended to `[[Vault/Security Reports/]]` and tagged `#audit`.

---

### Training and Awareness

- **Confidentiality Training**:
  - All contributors are provided the `[[Code of Conduct and Security Training.md]]` before onboarding.
  - Training covers handling, labeling, and sharing procedures.

- **Awareness Campaigns**:
  - Security reminders are added to the task Kanban and embedded as headers in README.md files for any sensitive repo.

---

### Incident Response Plan

- **Breach Response Procedures**:
  - A defined `[[Incident Response Playbook.md]]` outlines the steps for quarantine, investigation, rollback, and external notification.

- **Reporting Mechanisms**:
  - A vault-linked Google Form logs any suspected breach or misclassification for internal review.

---

### Compliance and Legal Requirements

- **Compliance with Data Protection Laws**:
  - The project complies with Canadian PIPEDA requirements for storage of personal and confidential data.

- **Legal Obligations**:
  - All proprietary materials are protected under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 unless otherwise specified.

---

Enforcing these confidentiality and security practices ensures that the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** operates safely, respects contributor privacy, and safeguards original innovations. Ongoing reviews and training guarantee that the security model evolves with the project's scope and exposure.
