# Historical Data

- **Past Projects**: References to documentation, performance reviews, and feedback from earlier puppet and controller development efforts prior to the Control Freaks Puppet Project.

---
Leveraging historical data from previous design, prototyping, and testing efforts is critical for informed planning and risk mitigation in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**. This section compiles and references relevant data from past initiatives to guide current decision-making.

## Historical Data References for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Past Project Data

- **Project 1: Eyeblink Servo Rig (Prototype V0.5)**  
  - **Description**: Developed a minimal servo control mechanism for blinking an animatronic eye with limited synchronization features.  
  - **Relevant Data Points**:
    - Servo lifespan testing showed significant jitter after 40 continuous hours.
    - Limitations encountered with PWM noise interference.
    - Iteration logs reveal early firmware loop inefficiencies.
  - **Document Reference**: `[[Archive/Prototypes/Eyeblink_Rig_v0.5_Postmortem.md]]`

- **Project 2: Audio-Servo Sync Bench (Fall 2024 Capstone)**  
  - **Description**: An exploratory project attempting real-time audio envelope extraction to drive servo movement in sync with human speech.  
  - **Relevant Data Points**:
    - Timing offsets recorded using analog audio processing (~150ms average delay).
    - Overheating documented in SG90 servo clusters beyond 2-min runtime.
    - Identified need for buffer-tuned motion profiles.
  - **Document Reference**: `[[Archive/Capstones/AudioSync_ServoBench_2024Q4_Report.pdf]]`

---

### Lessons Learned

- **Compiled Lessons**:
  - Passive cooling was insufficient for servo clusters in enclosed head enclosures.
  - Low-cost PCA9685 boards exhibited random jitter under I2C bus congestion.
  - Direct 5V power rails caused unexpected brownouts during peak loads.
- **Documentation Reference**:
  - `[[Archive/Lessons/Learned_ServoControl_2024.md]]`
  - `[[Archive/Lessons/PWM_Jitter_Mitigation.docx]]`

---

### Performance Metrics and Benchmarks

- **Historical Performance Data**:
  - Average prototype delivery cycle: 9‚Äì11 weeks from schematic to bench testing.
  - Servo fail rate: ~12% (using clone SG90s).
  - Audio sync error margin: ¬±220 ms (unfiltered, analog).
- **Benchmark Reference**:
  - `[[Archive/Benchmarks/Servo_Tolerance_Benchmarks.csv]]`
  - `[[Reports/Performance/Audio_Sync_Benchmarking.pdf]]`

---

### Stakeholder Feedback

- **Past Stakeholder Feedback**:
  - Feedback from course supervisors emphasized clearer controller-to-action feedback loops.
  - Test users recommended improved lip-sync believability and longer runtime endurance.
- **Feedback Documentation**:
  - `[[Archive/Feedback/Instructor_Review_Fall2024.pdf]]`
  - `[[Archive/Feedback/User_Trials_AudioPuppet.xlsx]]`

Utilizing this structured historical data from earlier prototypes and experimental setups enables the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** team to avoid previously encountered bottlenecks, maintain performance expectations, and enhance future hardware reliability. These records serve as baselines for testing, design iteration, and system improvements.
