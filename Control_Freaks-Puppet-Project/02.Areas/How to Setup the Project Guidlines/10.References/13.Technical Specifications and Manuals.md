### Access and Usage

- **Accessibility**:
  - All technical documentation is stored within the `/Resources/References/Technical/` folder of the project vault and backed up to the GDrive reference archive.
  - Obsidian note links are used for direct referencing in component cards and build logs.

- **Usage Guidelines**:
  - For any prototype, the most recent spec version must be cited.
  - Changes to usage patterns (e.g., voltage, current draw, timing protocol) must be verified against datasheets.
  - Use the `[[Component-Spec Checklist]]` to validate compatibility before procurement or design changes.

---

### Updates and Version Control

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Datasheets and manuals are reviewed every quarter or when component suppliers release new revisions.
  - Any outdated or deprecated reference is marked with `#archive` and replaced.

- **Version Tracking**:
  - All files are named with version numbers (e.g., `PCA9685_Datasheet_v3.2.pdf`) and logged in the `[[Document Version Tracker]]`.

---

This structured system ensures that all technical documentation for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** remains current, accessible, and relevant. It supports design accuracy, risk mitigation, and technical alignment across all stages of puppet and controller development.
