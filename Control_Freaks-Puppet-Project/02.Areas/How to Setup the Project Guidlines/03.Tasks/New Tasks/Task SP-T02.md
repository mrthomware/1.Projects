# Task SP-T02 ‚Äì Create Storyboard and Shot List

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: SP-T02

- **Description**:  
  Develop a visual storyboard and a corresponding shot list for the scripted puppet performance. Each scene should be sketched or mapped to indicate camera angles, puppet movement cues, scene duration, and transition logic.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-19  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-21

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Break script into visual scenes  
  - Sketch or use placeholders to represent each shot  
  - Define camera type, angle, and movement per scene  
  - Specify expected puppet actions, emotion cues, and transitions  
  - Prepare printable and digital shot list references

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Script from SP-T01  
  - Storyboard template  
  - Drawing tools (Procreate, Obsidian Canvas, or paper sketches)  
  - Camera setup references

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of SP-T01 (Script and Dialogue)  
  - Basic puppet movement validation to know pose limits (PD-T12)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Limited flexibility in physical rig movement may affect shot selection  
  - Sketching or planning too detailed early may reduce adaptability  
  - Camera setup may not match ideal framing in small studio space

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Directly informs cue sheet development (SP-T04)  
  - Essential for framing puppet motion during recording (SP-T06)  
  - Enables consistency across takes and efficient shooting schedule

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Review shot complexity to ensure it matches available gear  
  - Validate scene order and emotional flow with rough animatic if possible

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May require reboarding if puppeteer reach is limited  
  - Add optional cutaway/B-roll placeholders if needed for flexibility
