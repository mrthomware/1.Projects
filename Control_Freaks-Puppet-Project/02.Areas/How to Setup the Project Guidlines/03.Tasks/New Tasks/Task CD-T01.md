# Task CD-T01 ‚Äì Draft Servo Control Block Diagram

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T01

- **Description**:  
  Create an initial block diagram representing the full servo control architecture for the puppet system. This includes signal flow from the microcontroller (MCU) to each servo channel, power management modules, input triggers, and audio sync elements. The diagram will serve as the foundation for schematic design and firmware mapping.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-06-13  
- **End Date**: 2025-06-14

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  Task not yet initiated. Once started, the block diagram will be sketched first on paper, then formalized in Fritzing or KiCAD.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Notebook + pen for concept drafts
  - Fritzing or KiCAD software
  - Reference materials: Servo datasheets, MCU specs

- **Dependencies**:
  - None. This task begins the controller development phase.

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - May require iterations to account for physical layout or component constraints downstream.
  - Signal clarity and modularity need to be preserved to avoid miscommunication during schematic handoff.

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Establishes system logic for the entire controller path.
  - Any missteps here can cause delays in schematic, PCB design, or firmware planning.
  - Critical for firmware-task alignment (e.g., CD-T10).

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider routing redundancies or spare I/O in case future expansion (e.g., lighting or auxiliary features) is desired.
  
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If power draw estimates exceed safe limits, diagram will split regulator stages or include MOSFET switches in future steps.
