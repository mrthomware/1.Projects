# Task PD-T08 ‚Äì Route Wires and Secure with Strain Relief

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T08

- **Description**:  
  Carefully route all internal servo and signal wires through designed wire channels and secure them using strain relief techniques. This ensures stable operation, prevents internal damage, and maintains serviceability.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-08  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-09

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Feed servo wires through internal mounts with minimal bending  
  - Use adhesive cable anchors and clips for fixed routing  
  - Apply zip ties or heat-shrink tubing at connection stress points  
  - Keep slack at controller ports to allow repositioning or board swap

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Servo extension cables  
  - Zip ties (mini), heat shrink sleeves  
  - Wire clips, hot glue, adhesive anchors  
  - Multimeter for continuity checks

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of PD-T07 (paint must be fully cured)  
  - All servo and electronics modules prepared in advance

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Tight internal space may cause difficult routing angles  
  - Paint layer may interfere with adhesive bonding  
  - Excess wire slack can interfere with joint movement

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Ensures reliable electrical connections during operation  
  - Reduces risk of shorts or wear during motion  
  - Clean wiring contributes to serviceability and future upgrades

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Wire routing photos should be documented for future maintenance  
  - Tag ends for servo ID reference (e.g., Jaw, Eyebrow, Eye_L)

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May switch to braided sleeves if adhesion fails  
  - Reserve space for potential circuit add-ons
