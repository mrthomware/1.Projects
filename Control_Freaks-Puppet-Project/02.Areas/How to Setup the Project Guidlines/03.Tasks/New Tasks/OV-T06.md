# Task OV-T06 ‚Äì Export Final Timeline, Risk, and Milestone Reports

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: OV-T06

- **Description**:  
  Consolidate and export the final versions of key project management documents, including the project timeline, risk log, and milestone tracker. These documents must be formatted for both internal Vault archiving and external sharing (PDF, Markdown, or HTML formats).

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-09-26  
- **End Date**: 2025-09-27

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:
  - Locate finalized versions of:
    - `Timeline.md`
    - `Milestones.md`
    - `Risks_and_Issues.md`
  - Use Markdown Exporter or Pandoc to generate PDFs
  - Bundle all three into a ZIP archive for deliverables folder
  - Cross-verify data accuracy and date formats

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Obsidian Vault  
  - Pandoc (for markdown to PDF)  
  - Vault export scripts (optional automation)

- **Dependencies**:
  - OV-T05: Validated links and metadata  
  - Review Points in `Review_Points.md` must be locked

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Formatting inconsistencies between Markdown and PDF  
  - File path misalignment in embedded links may break output  
  - Exporting Gantt charts from Mermaid may require SVG conversion

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Delivers final project documentation for review and archiving  
  - Forms part of the postmortem analysis and retrospective notes  
  - Supports downstream reuse of planning frameworks in future builds

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Maintain identical file names between Vault and export outputs  
  - Double-check PDF rendering for code blocks and Mermaid visuals

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If export errors persist, fallback to Markdown + styled HTML  
  - Consider tagging exported files with version IDs for traceability
