# Task SP-T03 ‚Äì Choose Camera Angles, Lenses, and Test Lighting Setups

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: SP-T03

- **Description**:  
  Select optimal camera angles and lenses for each storyboarded scene. Conduct lighting tests to evaluate shadows, highlights, puppet visibility, and color fidelity. Adjust configurations to suit puppet dimensions and studio constraints.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-22  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-24

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Review storyboard shots and determine fixed vs. dynamic angles  
  - Choose lens focal lengths based on puppet scale and distance  
  - Test key, fill, and rim lighting setups using available gear  
  - Photograph test scenes and annotate lighting/camera setups  
  - Adjust positioning to avoid unwanted shadows and overexposure

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Storyboard from SP-T02  
  - DSLR camera or equivalent video-capable device  
  - LED softbox lighting, reflectors, black wrap  
  - Tripods, C-stands, clamps

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of SP-T02 (Storyboard and Shot List)  
  - Access to puppeteer rig for movement trial

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Small studio space limits lens options for wide framing  
  - Light spill and reflective puppet surfaces may require flagging  
  - Adjustments for natural light variability (if shooting over days)

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Ensures video footage is clean, professional, and expressive  
  - Prevents post-production challenges related to poor lighting  
  - Sets technical baseline for SP-T06 (performance recording)

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider backdrop color influence on puppet contrast  
  - Validate lighting matches tone of story (e.g., bright vs. moody)

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May introduce additional bounce boards or gels for corrections  
  - Camera height may be constrained by rig or puppet base visibility
