# Task CD-T11 ‚Äì Write Firmware Base Structure (Serial, Servo Library)

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T11

- **Description**:  
  Develop the foundational firmware framework for the puppet controller. This includes setting up serial communication, importing servo control libraries, initializing system parameters, and preparing modular placeholders for motion and sync routines. Code must be compatible with both the test rig and the target puppet system.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-07  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-09

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Set up basic serial input and output
  - Integrate servo library with pin mappings from schematic
  - Prepare stub functions for command parser and timed movement routines
  - Upload to microcontroller and verify serial & servo response

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Microcontroller dev board (e.g. ATmega328P or ESP32)
  - Servo library (e.g., Arduino Servo.h or custom PWM driver)
  - Schematic and PCB design files from CD-T04‚ÄìCD-T05

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T09 (Power system verified)
  - CD-T10 (Firmware logic plan available)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Avoid hardcoded values to maintain modularity
  - Must ensure electrical safety for first upload to active PCB

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Provides core framework for all firmware features including serial control, servo positioning, and audio synchronization
  - Enables motion testing in CD-T12 and foundation for CD-T13 sync logic

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Add verbose serial debugging options for each block
  - Avoid deep nesting in initial parser logic

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Abstract I/O pin mapping to a config header
  - Add watchdog timer if stability issues arise during CD-T12
