# Task CD-T10 ‚Äì Plan Firmware Logic via Flowcharts and Pseudocode

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T10

- **Description**:  
  Design the firmware architecture for the puppet controller by creating detailed flowcharts and pseudocode for each major functional block. This includes startup sequence, command parser, serial communication handler, servo position routines, and the audio-sync control logic scaffold. Ensure diagrams are modular and align with system requirements from CD-T01‚ÄìCD-T09.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-04  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-06

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  Begin with sketching high-level system logic. Break down into submodules (e.g., motion, timing, input parsing). Use standard ANSI flowchart symbols. Draft pseudocode for each functional block to guide implementation in CD-T11.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Whiteboard or Lucidchart/Mermaid for flowcharts
  - Notebook or Markdown editor for pseudocode
  - Input: Block diagram from CD-T01
  - References: `Servo_Command_Spec.md`, `Timing_Control_Notes.md`

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T01 (System block diagram)
  - CD-T09 (Power test confirms readiness for firmware)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Need to balance flexibility and code footprint
  - Clear modular boundaries must be maintained to avoid scope bloat

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Critical planning phase that ensures firmware structure is scalable, testable, and easy to debug
  - Output directly influences implementation (CD-T11) and sync timing module (CD-T13)

---

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Ensure flowchart logic maps clearly to code modules
  - Pseudocode should reflect fallback behaviors for servo errors

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Break up overly complex routines into subroutines early
  - Update any assumptions if hardware testing shows timing conflicts
