# Task CD-T02 ‚Äì Design Schematic in CAD Software

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T02

- **Description**:  
  Translate the approved block diagram into a formal schematic using electrical CAD software. This includes placing all major components such as the microcontroller, servo headers, power regulation circuitry, and connectors for debugging and programming. Net labeling and signal flow must conform to good electrical design practices and support subsequent PCB layout.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-06-14  
- **End Date**: 2025-06-17

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  Awaiting completion of CD-T01. Once initiated, schematic capture will begin in KiCAD 7 with a focus on clear labeling, modular grouping, and minimal cross-routing.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - KiCAD 7 with library access
  - Block diagram from CD-T01
  - Microcontroller and component datasheets (e.g., voltage regulators, servo pins)
  - Project-specific symbol and footprint libraries

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T01 must be complete and approved.
  - Knowledge of current consumption and control logic from firmware planning.

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Pin selection and trace grouping must anticipate layout constraints.
  - Errors here will propagate into PCB routing and firmware pin mappings.

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Direct input for CD-T03 (ERC + net validation) and CD-T04 (PCB layout).
  - Miswiring or poor schematic organization will increase debugging time during testing phases.

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Verify that all power and ground planes are explicitly routed and decoupling capacitors are appropriately placed.

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If design exceeds board space or pin limits, consider re-partitioning system into daughterboards or I2C-controlled modules.
