# Task OV-T04 ‚Äì Link Controller Diagrams and Shell Models into MOCs

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: OV-T04

- **Description**:  
  Embed finalized controller schematics, PCB layout images, and puppet shell 3D model snapshots into their respective Maps of Content (MOCs). Ensure cross-links between documentation sections allow for intuitive navigation between controller logic, mechanical design, and system integration notes.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-09-23  
- **End Date**: 2025-09-25

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:
  - Add controller schematic PNGs and PCB layer visualizations to `MOC_Controller.md`
  - Insert orthographic puppet views and 3D render exports into `MOC_Puppet_Design.md`
  - Establish backlinks between:
    - Test logs and bench schematics
    - CAD models and assembly procedures
  - Ensure naming and tagging conforms to PARA/MOC naming conventions

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Fusion360 and KiCAD export images  
  - Existing MOC notes from Vault  
  - YAML front matter + image embed markdown syntax

- **Dependencies**:
  - OV-T01: Backup structure  
  - PD-T02: 3D CAD Models  
  - CD-T04: Verified Controller Layouts

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - File format compatibility (SVG/PNG/PDF) within Obsidian preview  
  - Link clutter ‚Äî ensure MOCs remain readable and skimmable

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Increases visual clarity across the Vault  
  - Supports onboarding or future reuse by making systems understandable at a glance  
  - Makes final documentation pitch-ready for stakeholders or collaborators

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider alternate views for better cross-reference (e.g., exploded assembly diagrams)  
  - Use collapsible headings to reduce visual overwhelm

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May split MOC_Puppet_Design.md if file becomes too long post-image inclusion  
  - Adjust asset locations if they conflict with current vault search/index patterns
