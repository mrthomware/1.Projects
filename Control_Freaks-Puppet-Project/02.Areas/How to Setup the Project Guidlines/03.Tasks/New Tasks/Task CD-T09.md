# Task CD-T09 ‚Äì Initial Power-On Test and Voltage Validation

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T09

- **Description**:  
  Perform initial power-on of the fully assembled PCB to validate correct voltage outputs across all power rails. This includes checking 5V servo power, 3.3V logic levels, and verifying that all voltage regulators operate within tolerance. The task must ensure that there are no short circuits, overheating components, or unstable outputs before connecting any servos.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-02  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-03

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  Begin with continuity checks and power rail isolation. Apply power through current-limited bench supply. Log voltage readings at VCC, GND, logic levels, and key pin headers. Confirm onboard LED diagnostics where applicable. Halt immediately if overcurrent is detected.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Fully assembled PCB from CD-T08
  - Bench power supply with current limiting
  - Multimeter and oscilloscope
  - Load resistor dummy devices
  - Reference: `Voltage_Test_Map.pdf`

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T08 (Board assembly completed and visually inspected)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Risk of component burnout from miswiring or regulator faults
  - Difficult-to-locate shorts or cold solder joints

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Critical go/no-go validation step for firmware upload and servo testing
  - Failure here may require desoldering or PCB revision

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Log all test points and results in `Voltage_Log.md` under Test Report section
  - Capture thermal image if temperature rises near voltage regulators

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If voltage regulators are unstable, swap with known-good units from test stock
  - Consider solder wick rework if short is detected
