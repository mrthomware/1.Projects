# Task CD-T03 ‚Äì Perform ERC and Net Validation

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T03

- **Description**:  
  Conduct an Electrical Rule Check (ERC) and netlist validation of the schematic created in CD-T02. This process ensures the electrical design adheres to standard practices, has no floating nets, unconnected pins, or electrical conflicts, and all net labels are correctly assigned for clean layout transition.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-06-17  
- **End Date**: 2025-06-18

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  Task awaits completion of schematic capture (CD-T02). Once imported into ERC tools, both auto-check and manual review processes will be run. Errors must be documented and resolved before moving to layout.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - KiCAD ERC toolset
  - KiCAD design rules configuration
  - Microcontroller pinout datasheet
  - Visual checklist for known signal issues

- **Dependencies**:
  - Must follow CD-T02 ‚Äì finalized schematic must be locked and verified.
  - Any change in net structure post-validation must trigger a re-run of ERC.

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - High risk of false positives if component libraries are improperly configured.
  - Unlabeled GND/POWER pins are common sources of ERC warnings.

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Critical gatekeeper for moving into physical layout (CD-T04).
  - Errors here could result in non-functional PCBs and costly reprints.

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Use named global labels for power rails to reduce GND/VCC confusion.
  - Ensure pull-up/pull-down resistors are present on floating logic inputs.

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If KiCAD library parts trigger persistent false errors, consider creating custom verified symbols.
