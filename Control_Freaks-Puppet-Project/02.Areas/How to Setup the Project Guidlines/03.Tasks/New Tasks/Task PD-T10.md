# Task PD-T10 ‚Äì Test Fit Movement and Check Clearances

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T10

- **Description**:  
  Verify that all puppet joints and mechanisms move freely without obstruction. This involves testing servo ranges manually and ensuring that internal components do not interfere with shell geometry or other hardware.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-11  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-12

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Manually activate each servo  
  - Observe linkage motion for smooth articulation  
  - Look for rubbing, binding, or spatial conflict  
  - Adjust mounting positions slightly if required

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Power supply (5V, 2A min)  
  - Servo tester or microcontroller with diagnostic sketch  
  - Small tools for minor repositioning  
  - Visual markers to track range limits

- **Dependencies**:
  - PD-T09 (servos must be installed)  
  - PD-T11 (calibration is next but relies on successful fit)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Puppet shell tolerances are tight; clearances may be minimal  
  - If joints bind, it may indicate CAD modeling error  
  - Adjustments at this stage are mechanical, not firmware-based

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Critical validation before servo calibration  
  - Ensures mechanical reliability and safety of motion range  
  - Prevents burn-out or jitter during programmed testing

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider photographing tight spots for future design improvement  
  - Label servos physically to match channel IDs for next task

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Servo horn repositioning may be required  
  - Optional: add silicone bumpers to limit max range if needed
