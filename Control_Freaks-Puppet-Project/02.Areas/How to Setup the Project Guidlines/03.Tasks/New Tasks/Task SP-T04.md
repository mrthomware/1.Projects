# Task SP-T04 ‚Äì Build Cue Sheets for Motion and Audio Sync

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: SP-T04

- **Description**:  
  Create detailed cue sheets that map out servo movements, facial gestures, audio clips, and dialogue timing. These sheets will serve as synchronization references during puppet performance and recording sessions.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-24  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-26

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Break down script and storyboard into timed motion/audio beats  
  - List individual servo cues for each syllable, blink, or gesture  
  - Sync dialogue lines to servo positions and transitions  
  - Include timestamps, line numbers, servo IDs, and intensity values  
  - Format final document into printable and screen-readable sheets

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Script from SP-T01  
  - Storyboard and shots from SP-T02  
  - Servo ID chart and PWM calibration data  
  - Audio rough cuts or voiceover dailies

- **Dependencies**:
  - SP-T01 (Script), SP-T02 (Storyboard), and CD-T13 (Audio Sync Module)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - High precision required for believable lip-sync and eye movements  
  - Managing overlapping motions without jitter or servo lag  
  - Cue density may require sheet segmentation per scene

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Essential for accurate and expressive puppet performance  
  - Reduces need for retakes or post-syncing corrections  
  - Foundation for SP-T05 (Rehearsals) and SP-T06 (Recording)

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider marking optional vs. mandatory cues to aid flexibility  
  - Use color codes for facial vs. body movements for clarity

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Can be revised during rehearsals to match final performance flow  
  - Cue sheets will be versioned and timestamped for tracking
