# Task PD-T02 ‚Äì Create 3D CAD Model of Skeleton and Shell

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T02

- **Description**:  
  Develop a full 3D CAD model of the puppet's internal skeleton and external shell using orthographic sketches from PD-T01. Include articulated regions (jaw, neck, arms) and internal compartments for servo mounts and cable routing. Maintain physical realism and print-ready design geometry.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-21  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-25

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Model is built in Fusion360 or equivalent CAD tool  
  - Include key anatomical layers: base structure, movement cutouts, servo chambers  
  - Review clearance and wall thickness for durability  
  - Ensure all components are separable for printing

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Fusion360 CAD software  
  - Completed orthographic sketches from PD-T01  
  - Servo datasheets and component footprints  
  - Measurement toolset (calipers, ruler)

- **Dependencies**:
  - PD-T01 completed and approved sketches  
  - Servo dimension specs from Phase 1 (Controller Development)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Balancing aesthetics with mechanical constraints  
  - Avoiding print errors due to unprintable geometry or overhangs  
  - Clearances for screws, wires, and servo mounts must be verified

- **Impact on Project**:
  - CAD model serves as the master geometry for slicing and 3D printing  
  - Defines build assembly approach and servo configuration  
  - Directly influences fabrication success in PD-T04‚ÄìPD-T06

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Schedule checkpoint for mentor review before finalizing export  
  - Incorporate feedback loop with puppeteer to ensure articulation matches performance needs

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If model becomes too complex, break into upper and lower subassemblies  
  - CAD files will be version-controlled and backed up weekly
