# Task PD-T05 ‚Äì 3D Print All Body and Mount Parts

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T05

- **Description**:  
  Print all structural and aesthetic parts of the puppet based on the sliced models prepared in the previous task. This includes external shell components, internal servo mounts, and mechanical joints. Monitor prints for quality, and log filament usage and any misprints or issues.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-28  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-02

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Ensure printer bed is level and extrusion is calibrated  
  - Load sliced files sequentially (head, torso, limbs, internal mounts)  
  - Print logs maintained with print durations, temperatures, and material usage  
  - Mid-print checks and camera monitoring enabled for overnight prints

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - G-code/STL files from PD-T04  
  - PLA+ and PETG filament rolls  
  - 3D printer (Creality Ender, Prusa MK3, or equivalent)  
  - Nozzle cleaning kit, scraper, adhesives

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of slicing (PD-T04)  
  - Finalized 3D models with verified tolerances  
  - Availability of filament and functioning printer

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Long print durations may cause time bottlenecks  
  - High-tolerance fits may need iterative reprints  
  - Warping or layer adhesion issues in larger parts

- **Impact on Project**:
  - These prints are the structural core of the puppet  
  - Print delays cascade into later tasks (PD-T06: cleaning, PD-T09: servo install)  
  - Successful prints ensure puppet durability and performance

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider batch printing smaller components together  
  - If prints fail repeatedly, adjust infill, temperature, or orientation

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Backup parts can be printed in alternate filament types if required  
  - Real-time slicer adjustments may be made if build time exceeds projection
