# Task PD-T12 ‚Äì Run Serial Commands for Real-Time Motion Validation

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T12

- **Description**:  
  Execute a full-body servo control test using live serial commands to validate real-time motion behavior. Ensure the puppet performs scripted movements in sync with operator input or queued sequences.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-15  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-16

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Load firmware with debug interface enabled  
  - Open serial console and send motion sequences line-by-line  
  - Log response times and note delays or stuttering  
  - Confirm servo ranges match those established in PD-T11  
  - Observe system power draw and response under load

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Arduino IDE with serial console  
  - Debugging laptop and USB interface  
  - Predefined movement scripts  
  - Power measurement tool (optional, e.g., USB power meter)

- **Dependencies**:
  - PD-T11 (calibrated PWM values)  
  - CD-T12 (motion test firmware uploaded)  
  - CD-T13 (sync module if testing with audio timing)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Overlapping or simultaneous servo commands may cause jitter  
  - Latency in serial interface may not reflect full automation fidelity  
  - Full range of motion must be safe within puppet enclosure limits

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Ensures puppet is performance-ready  
  - Verifies firmware-to-hardware command loop integrity  
  - Final QA step before transitioning to show pipeline

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Record movement sessions for reference  
  - Use color-coded spreadsheet to note any outlier servos

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Recalibrate servos on the fly if binding is detected  
  - Use alternate USB cable if serial behavior is unstable
