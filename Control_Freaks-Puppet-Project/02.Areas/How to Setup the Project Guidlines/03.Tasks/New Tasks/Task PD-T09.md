# Task PD-T09 ‚Äì Install Servos and Internal Hardware

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T09

- **Description**:  
  Securely mount all internal components including servos, brackets, mechanical linkages, and internal electronics into the puppet shell. This step finalizes hardware integration before motion validation.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-10  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-11

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Align and mount micro-servos to designed internal slots  
  - Fix control boards using standoff mounts or adhesive pads  
  - Install pushrods or linkage arms for jaw and eye control  
  - Pre-check moving clearances to avoid collision during testing

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Micro servos (x6‚Äì8 units)  
  - Mini brackets, linkages, screws  
  - Control board (custom PCB), nylon standoffs  
  - Small tools: screwdriver, Loctite, hex keys

- **Dependencies**:
  - PD-T08 (wires must be routed and ready)  
  - CD-T08 (controller PCB must be built)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Servo mounts must align precisely with mechanical centerlines  
  - Internal space tightness may complicate screw access  
  - Potential for wire pinching if strain relief isn‚Äôt secured

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Enables complete hardware validation  
  - Affects servo calibration and motion testing in following task  
  - Poor mounting can cause misalignment and mechanical wear

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Test fit all parts before final tightening  
  - Consider vibration padding under PCB if servo vibration is high

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May need to redesign one bracket if servo horn clearance is blocked  
  - PCB may shift position if better airflow or access is required
