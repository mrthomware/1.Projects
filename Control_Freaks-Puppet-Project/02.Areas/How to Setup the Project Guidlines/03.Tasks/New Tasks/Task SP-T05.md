# Task SP-T05 ‚Äì Rehearse Motion Scenes and Timing

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: SP-T05

- **Description**:  
  Conduct rehearsals of all puppet performance scenes using the cue sheets. Focus on perfecting motion timing, syncing gestures with audio playback, and ensuring fluid transitions between expressions and movements.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-08-27  
- **End Date**: 2025-08-28

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:
  - Load cue sequences into controller software or test script  
  - Play back audio tracks while puppet executes motions  
  - Manually tweak gestures for believability and pacing  
  - Log required adjustments or inconsistencies in timing  
  - Run full-scene rehearsals to validate sync integrity

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Cue sheets from SP-T04  
  - Servo controller board (CD-T14 tested)  
  - Audio tracks and playback hardware  
  - Puppet rig mounted and calibrated

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of SP-T04 (Cue Sheets)  
  - Hardware validated through CD-T14 (Test System on Bench Rig)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Servo jitter, audio desync, or physical clearance issues  
  - Repeated rehearsals may stress servo motors  
  - Requires solo operation of both performance and monitoring

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Confirms that all scenes are performable before actual recording  
  - Saves time and resources during production phase  
  - Informs final camera setups and shot durations

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Annotate cue sheets with real-world deviations observed during rehearsal  
  - Consider recording rehearsal videos for playback analysis

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Minor timing tweaks will be locked before SP-T06  
  - Servo delays above 100ms must be compensated in cue sheet
