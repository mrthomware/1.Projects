# Task CD-T04 ‚Äì Generate and Verify PCB Layout

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T04

- **Description**:  
  Transform the validated schematic into a printed circuit board (PCB) layout. This includes placing components, defining board dimensions, routing traces, and verifying layout constraints. Review should ensure signal integrity, appropriate trace widths, and mechanical compatibility with puppet form factor.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-06-19  
- **End Date**: 2025-06-22

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  Will begin upon successful ERC and netlist import. Board outline and mounting holes must align with puppet skeleton (PD-T03). Layout must meet spacing rules for low-voltage logic, servo headers, and power rails.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - KiCAD PCB Editor
  - Verified netlist from CD-T03
  - Puppet skeleton layout (DXF reference)
  - IPC-2221 standards (clearance and width)
  - Ground plane and decoupling capacitor guidelines

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of CD-T03 ‚Äì validated schematic with clean netlist.
  - Access to dimensional data from Phase 2 skeleton CAD (PD-T02).

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Tight form factor within puppet cavity.
  - Noise mitigation for mixed analog/digital traces.
  - Servo current traces may require 1oz copper and wider routing.

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Directly precedes fabrication prep (CD-T05).
  - Errors at this stage result in manufacturing delays or unusable PCBs.

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Prioritize ground pour consistency.
  - Route high-current servo lines away from signal traces to avoid EMI.

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Update layout plan if puppet mechanical dimensions shift in PD-T02.
