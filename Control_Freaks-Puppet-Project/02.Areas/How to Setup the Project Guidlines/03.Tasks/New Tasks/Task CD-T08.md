# Task CD-T08 ‚Äì Solder and Assemble PCB Components

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T08

- **Description**:  
  Assemble the final servo controller PCB by soldering all received components onto the fabricated board. Verify pin alignment, ensure solid solder joints, and follow correct component placement using the BOM and board layout diagrams. Pay special attention to polarity-sensitive components and spacing for heat dissipation.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-06-29  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-01

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  Begin with power regulation and MCU subsystems before moving to servo headers and I/O pins. Document completed sections with photos, and update soldering checklist in `Assembly_Logs.md`. SMD parts will be soldered under magnification with fine-point iron and flux pen.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Final PCB boards (from CD-T06)
  - Component set per BOM
  - Fine-tipped soldering iron, flux, tweezers
  - Isopropyl alcohol, magnifier lamp, ESD mat
  - Reference: `GerberView_Front_Back.pdf`

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T06 (Components ordered and received)
  - CD-T07 (Prototyping confirms design correctness)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Solder bridges or incorrect component placement
  - Sensitive ICs may require static-safe handling

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Core build milestone for controller hardware
  - Prepares system for power-on testing in CD-T09

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - If soldering time exceeds projection due to IC complexity, reprioritize passive sections to Day 2
  - Log resistance tests and post-solder visual inspection results before proceeding to power-up

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Any missing components must be sourced via overnight supplier or swapped with tested equivalents
