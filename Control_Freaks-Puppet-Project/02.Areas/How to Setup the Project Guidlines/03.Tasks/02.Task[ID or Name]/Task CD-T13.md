# Task CD-T13 ‚Äì Write and Integrate Audio-Sync Timing Module

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T13

- **Description**:  
  Develop a firmware module to synchronize servo motion with pre-recorded audio segments. This involves reading timestamped cues and executing servo position updates in sync. The module will be modular for reuse in future projects and will support adjustable sync tolerance and fallback behavior if cue delays occur.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-13  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-16

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Create data structure for timestamp-to-motion mappings  
  - Develop playback loop and timer interrupt-driven sync  
  - Integrate with existing motion subroutines from CD-T12  
  - Log timing drift and servo response latency for evaluation

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Audio cue sheets with timestamp markers  
  - Test audio files (.WAV, .MP3 trimmed clips)  
  - Serial debug interface  
  - Arduino-compatible microcontroller with sufficient timers

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T12 (motion routines working)  
  - SP-T04 (Cue sheet definitions, if available)  
  - PD-T12 (servo response validated under real-time commands)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Timer ISR conflicts with servo libraries  
  - Latency from playback loop execution  
  - Cue parsing speed for long audio durations

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Core component of realistic puppet performance  
  - Enables frame-accurate animation control needed for storytelling

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider using millis()/micros() for lightweight sync loop  
  - Cue data may be manually generated or later automated via audio analyzer tools

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May create a lookup table instead of parsing on-the-fly for long routines  
  - If hardware interrupts prove unreliable, switch to polling with error buffer
