# Task PD-T03 ‚Äì Design Internal Mounts and Wire Guides

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T03

- **Description**:  
  Create structural features inside the puppet's CAD model to securely mount servos, route wiring cleanly, and maintain serviceability. Design these elements to integrate with the skeleton and shell from PD-T02. Consider vibration damping and access for troubleshooting.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-26  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-27

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Mounting brackets modeled to fit servo footprints  
  - Design includes strain relief hooks, conduit paths, or internal clips  
  - Ensure routing does not interfere with moving parts or shell aesthetics  
  - Removable panels or hatches considered for key access points

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - CAD model from PD-T02  
  - Servo specifications (horn, screw, rotation zone)  
  - Cable type and gauge data  
  - Reference from past puppet builds (if available)

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of PD-T02  
  - Servo choices finalized in CD-T06 and CD-T08  
  - Knowledge of puppet articulation range

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Tight space constraints within compact puppet body  
  - Risk of wire abrasion or servo binding if not routed properly  
  - Must preserve modularity for maintenance and upgrades

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Ensures reliability during live performances or test runs  
  - Reduces chances of servo failure or wiring disconnection  
  - Sets foundation for successful electrical integration in PD-T08

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Validate bracket placement with puppeteer motion tests  
  - Review servo load paths to avoid cracking PLA or resin

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Add optional redundant routing paths  
  - If servo model changes, adjust cavity tolerances accordingly
