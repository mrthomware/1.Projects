# Task: Hinge Calibration & Motion Scripting

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T010
- **Description**: Develop and calibrate the servo hinge ranges for jaw, eyelids, and other articulated features. Write motion scripts that define position profiles, acceleration curves, and loop timing for expressive, repeatable behaviors. Deliverables include a calibrated motion map for each hinge, Arduino/ESP32 control code, and performance logs from initial run cycles.
- **Assigned To**: Software Lead
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-25
- **End Date**: 2025-06-27
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Initial motion ranges gathered from mechanical specs
  - Scripting framework outline pending approval
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
  - Serial monitor and servo tester for live feedback
  - Predefined motion presets from Creative Team
  - Obsidian logs for versioned testing results
- **Dependencies**:
  - Installation of jaw and facial mechanisms (CF-T003, CF-T009)
  - Electrical integration complete (CF-T002, CF-T006)
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Servo jitter or overshoot during rapid sequence
  - Matching motion smoothness with skin elasticity
  - Ensuring safe limits to avoid over-rotation or burnouts
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Defines the "soul" of the puppet's movement
  - Required for synchronized performance and programmable expressions
  - Affects demonstration quality, loop control, and user experience

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Creative lead suggested adding micro-delays to enhance realism in blinking sequences
  - FX Team requested preview of slow-speed tests for skin stress validation
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Codebase may be migrated to ESP32-C3 if advanced control curves or BLE triggers are required
  - Add calibration override mode for technician fine-tuning
