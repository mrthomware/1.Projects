# Task: Puppet Skin Material Test & Fabrication

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T007
- **Description**: Conduct material testing for the puppet's skin to evaluate realism, flexibility, durability, and compatibility with servo actuation. Once the ideal material is selected (e.g., silicone, latex, foam latex), fabricate the skin to match the puppetâ€™s head and body model. The final skin must be paintable, bond well to anchor points, and support modular reapplication for maintenance or restyling.
- **Assigned To**: FX Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-15
- **End Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Sample ordering planned for June 14
  - Initial mold sculpt references imported from CAD model (CF-T004)
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Silicone kits (PlatSil Gel-10, Ecoflex 00-30)
  - Mold release, fabric mesh reinforcement
  - 3D-printed negative molds for test patches
  - Acrylic paints and silicone pigments
- **Dependencies**:
  - Final dimensions from 3D shell model (CF-T004)
  - Jaw and eye motion clearance specs (CF-T003, CF-T009)
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Finding a material that balances stretch and facial detailing
  - Avoiding tearing near high-strain areas (mouth, eyes)
  - Matching skin tone and texture for realism
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Directly affects visual quality and believability of the puppet
  - Integral to camera and audience presentation
  - Influences perception of professional quality in final demos and media

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Request from Creative Team to experiment with translucent overlays for eye region
  - Engineering noted concern about adhesive type compatibility with internal brackets
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Switch to foam latex backup plan if silicone proves too rigid at final thickness
  - May extend task end date by 2 days for pigment cure cycle tests
