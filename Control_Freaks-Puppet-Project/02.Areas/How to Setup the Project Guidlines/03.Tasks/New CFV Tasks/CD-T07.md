# Task CD-T07 ‚Äì Breadboard Prototype Key Modules Before Final Soldering

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T07

- **Description**:  
  Prototype the core functional sections of the controller (e.g., voltage regulation, MCU communication, servo control channels) on a breadboard before proceeding to full PCB assembly. Validate logic-level shifting, voltage output consistency, and servo pulse generation under load.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-06-26  
- **End Date**: 2025-06-28

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  This task reduces risk by catching circuit errors early. Focus on critical sections only‚Äîpower stage, MCU I/O, and audio sync logic. Logs of successful tests and schematics used for breadboarding should be recorded under `/Testing/Prototype_Logs.md`.

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Breadboard, jumper wires, logic analyzer
  - Bench PSU, multimeter, oscilloscope
  - Sample servos, microcontroller dev board
  - Circuit test scripts and sample firmware from CD-T11

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T06 must be completed and components received
  - CD-T02 schematic reference and CD-T03 validation

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Breadboard capacitance may distort high-speed signals
  - Servo current draw may brown-out MCU; use bypass caps

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Allows early fault detection in circuit design before soldering
  - Directly impacts success of CD-T08 and reduces rework costs

---

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - If high current draw destabilizes breadboard, prototype power stage separately using PCB breakout
  - Document all logic-level results and include pinout diagrams for internal vault use

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If timing-critical signals fail on breadboard, defer to partial PCB reflow test for further debugging
