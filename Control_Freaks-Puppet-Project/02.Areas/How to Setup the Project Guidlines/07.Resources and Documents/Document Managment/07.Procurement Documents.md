# 📦 Procurement Documents

- **Contracts and Agreements**: Documents related to procurement and suppliers.

---
Procurement documents are vital for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, especially due to the need for precise component sourcing, limited budget, and the solo nature of the work. These documents support structured acquisition of electronic parts, puppet materials, and specialized software licenses—all tracked within the Obsidian Vault for transparency and control.
