## 🧾 Project Plan for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 🎯 Project Overview

- **Objectives**:
  - Design and build a fully functional animatronic puppet system.
  - Develop a PCB-based servo controller with audio-synced motion firmware.
  - Produce a pipeline to create character-driven YouTube puppet shows.
  - Maintain full documentation, traceability, and task control using Obsidian.

- **Scope**:
  - **In Scope**: Technical design (hardware + software), fabrication, animation, documentation.
  - **Out of Scope**: Outsourced production, team-based delegation, large-scale distribution.

### 🕒 Timelines

#### 📆 Project Schedule
A full **Mermaid Gantt chart** will be included in the Timeline Document, scheduled as follows:
- Controller Development: June 13 → July 20
- Puppet Development: July 21 → August 15
- Show Pipeline Development: August 16 → September 20
- Vault Integration: September 21 → October 10

All tasks are strictly **sequential**, with no overlaps, in line with solo developer constraints.

#### 🔁 Timeline Flexibility

- Each milestone includes a 3–5 day buffer.
- Documented fallback recovery plan for each major delay.

### ⚠️ Risk Management

#### 🧮 Risk Analysis

| Risk                     | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                        |
|--------------------------|--------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Burned-out servos        | High   | Medium     | Spare inventory, test before install |
| PCB logic errors         | High   | Medium     | Pre-manufacturing DRC & simulation |
| Audio sync inaccuracies  | Medium | High       | Frame-by-frame test in review loop |

#### 🔧 Mitigation Strategies

- Maintain component stock buffer.
- Schedule dedicated firmware debug sessions.
- Reserve time for iterative corrections.

---

### 📡 Communication Plan

#### 🧭 Internal Communication
