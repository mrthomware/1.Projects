# 📊 Gantt Chart

- **Schedule Representation**: Timeline showing tasks, duration, dependencies.

---
A Gantt Chart is an essential project management tool that visually represents the schedule of the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**. It displays the start and end dates, duration, and dependencies of each task in a clear, linear format—supporting effective solo task management, planning, and coordination.

---

## 📅 Gantt Chart – Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 🔍 Overview

- **Purpose**: This Gantt Chart serves as a visual representation of the project's timeline. It details the sequential flow of tasks across the four project phases:  
  1. Controller Development  
  2. Puppet Development  
  3. Show Pipeline Development  
  4. Obsidian Vault Integration  
- The timeline emphasizes the **solo developer constraint**: all tasks are performed strictly **one at a time**, with no parallel execution.

---

### 🧱 Components

- **Tasks**: Each task is labeled with its unique task ID (e.g., `CD-T01`, `PD-T05`, etc.) and linked to the corresponding deliverable in the PARA task registry.
- **Duration**: Each task includes exact day spans defined in its YAML metadata.
- **Start/End Dates**: Pulled from the validated "New CFV Tasks" directory.
- **Dependencies**: Enforced via the `after` clause in the Mermaid syntax, maintaining strict sequential flow.

### 🔗 Integration with Project Plan

- **WBS Alignment**: The chart strictly follows the **Work Breakdown Structure**, with task IDs grouped under their corresponding phases.
- **Resource Allocation**: Each task reflects the timeline of a **solo developer**, respecting both feasibility and flow.

---

### 📈 Progress Tracking

- **Milestones**: Clearly represented as task boundaries (e.g., end of `CD-T10`, `PD-T07`, etc.).
- **Update Protocol**: The chart is updated weekly during Progress Sync sessions. All changes are committed to the Vault.

---

### 🛠 Usage

- **Tool for Solo Dev**: Serves as the master tracker of all deliverables, durations, and inter-task logic.
- **Stakeholder Transparency**: Supports presentation-ready formatting for instructors, sponsors, and YouTube update videos.

---

This **Gantt Chart** is a foundational visual tool for ensuring the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** remains on track. It enforces logical task progression, buffers realistic durations, and aligns with overall milestones and dependencies to maintain clarity and deliverability.
