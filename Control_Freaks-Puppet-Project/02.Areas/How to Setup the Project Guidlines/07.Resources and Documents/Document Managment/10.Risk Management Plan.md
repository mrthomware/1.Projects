# ⚠️ Risk Management Plan

- **Risk Assessment**: Identification of potential risks and mitigation strategies.

---
The **Risk Management Plan** for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** outlines a proactive framework for identifying, assessing, and managing risks across the four core phases of development. By addressing threats early, this plan protects progress, quality, and deadlines within the constraints of a solo developer project.

## 🧾 Risk Management Plan for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 🎯 Introduction

- **Purpose**:  
  This plan enables systematic identification, evaluation, and response to potential risks that could disrupt design, fabrication, testing, or documentation. It is embedded within the Obsidian Vault and reviewed continuously to adapt to project evolution.

### 🔍 Risk Identification

#### 🛑 Potential Risks

| Type             | Description                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical         | PCB routing errors, firmware bugs, servo misalignment             |
| Supply Chain      | Servo delays, filament shortages, PCB fab turnaround              |
| Schedule          | Missed milestones due to debugging or part replacements           |
| Financial         | Cost overruns, shipping fees, failed components                   |
| Creative Output   | Animation sync mismatch, audio distortion, unsatisfactory visuals |
| Documentation     | Vault sync loss, template errors, YAML metadata break             |

#### 🎯 Sources of Risk

- Internal: Solo development workload, design complexity, Obsidian schema scaling
- External: Supplier delays, shipping logistics, third-party tool/API changes

### 📊 Risk Assessment

#### 🔎 Risk Analysis Table

| Risk                          | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Notes                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------|
| Servo Failure During Testing  | Medium     | High   | High     | Preorder extras, test at low torque    |
| PCB Manufacturing Delay       | Medium     | Medium | Medium   | Order early in CD-T06                  |
| Firmware Sync Drift           | High       | High   | High     | Design buffer into timeline            |
| Audio Engine API Change       | Low        | High   | Medium   | Backup voice lines in WAV format       |
| Vault Corruption              | Low        | High   | Medium   | Daily backup of `.obsidian` structure  |

#### 🚦 Risk Prioritization

- Focus mitigation efforts on:
  - Controller Design errors (CD-T01 to CD-T08)
  - Servo misbehavior in puppet integration (PD-T06 to PD-T10)
  - Audio/visual desync in final scenes (SP-T07 to SP-T11)

### 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

#### 📝 Risk Response Planning

| Risk                        | Strategy                              |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| PCB Trace Failure           | Use wider power traces, test ERC rigorously |
| Component Delay             | Source from secondary vendors, group orders |
| Audio Drift in Show         | Use fixed animation-timing segments    |
| Budget Overrun              | Freeze upgrades, reuse components      |

#### 🧯 Contingency Plans

| Trigger                     | Action Plan                            |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| PCB rejected by fab         | Use earlier revision, initiate fallback |
| Servo burnout               | Replace with backup, note in task log   |
| Voiceover tool outage       | Switch to manual line recording         |
