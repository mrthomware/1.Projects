# ✅ Quality Management Plan

- **Quality Standards**: Defined standards and procedures for quality assurance.

---
The **Quality Management Plan** ensures that every element of the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**—from hardware to performance output—meets clearly defined technical and creative standards. This document establishes structured methods for quality assurance (QA), control (QC), feedback, and continuous improvement across the project’s four core phases.

## 🧾 Quality Management Plan for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 🎯 Introduction

- **Purpose of the Plan**:  
  To define the quality expectations, standards, and processes for this project, ensuring that all deliverables are accurate, functional, creative, and aligned with the stakeholder (instructor + audience) requirements. This plan governs QA during controller design, puppet fabrication, performance, and documentation.

### 📐 Quality Standards

#### 🛠️ Project-Specific Standards

| Component             | Standard Applied                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| PCB Design            | IPC-2221 Layout Guidelines, DRC/ERC compliance    |
| Puppet Mechanics      | Joint articulation with 3-cycle endurance         |
| Firmware Timing       | Servo response < 80ms from audio sync             |
| Voice Performance     | Clean sync of audio to puppet articulation        |
| Documentation         | Structured PARA framework with YAML compliance    |

#### ⚖️ Compliance Requirements

- All electronics and fabricated elements must be safe for lab/studio use.
- No project components shall violate school policy or public safety guidelines.
- Obsidian Vault output must conform to file structuring for assessment review.

### 🔧 Quality Assurance Procedures

#### 🧪 QA Process

| Phase                        | QA Activity                     | Tools/Methods Used              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Controller Development       | Schematic review + test rig loop| ERC, Netlist validation, KiCAD  |
| Puppet Development           | Mechanical testing               | Joint stress test, fit validation|
| Show Pipeline                | Timing check + voice match       | Manual sync & test playback     |
| Obsidian Vault Integration   | Vault schema audit               | YAML linting, File structure map|

#### 👤 Responsibility Assignment

- QA for all stages is owned and executed by **Thomas Ware**
- Each QA pass is documented as a subheading in each task note
- Devlog visuals serve as qualitative QA confirmations for YouTube community

### 🛡️ Quality Control Measures

#### 🧰 QC Techniques

| Activity               | QC Method                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| PCB Output             | Gerber viewer + fab pre-check    |
| Servo Movement         | Bench test with known sequences  |
| Print Accuracy         | Caliper + manual fit test        |
| Audio Sync             | Time marker overlay + mouth match|
| Vault Reports          | Markdown preview and structure test |

#### 🔁 Corrective Actions

- Errors logged in task notes under `## Challenges or Issues`
- Follow-up tasks triggered by issue tag (`#issue`)
- Preventive measures flagged in `## Adjustments or Changes`

---

### 📊 Monitoring and Reporting

#### 📏 Quality Metrics

| Metric                        | Target Standard               |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| PCB Trace Clearance           | ≥ IPC minimums (e.g. 0.2mm)   |
| Puppet Servo Joint Deviation  | ≤ 5° after 3 repetitions      |
| Audio-to-Servo Lag            | ≤ 80ms                        |
| Vault Conformance Score       | 100% YAML + folder alignment  |

#### 📆 Regular Quality Reviews

- Conducted at the end of each phase
- Reported in:
  - `Progress Updates.md`
  - `Milestone Review.md`
  - YouTube Devlog Recap

#### 📢 Reporting Mechanism

- QA results embedded in each task under `## Progress Details`
- End-of-phase summary exported as PDF for instructor
- Issues escalated in real-time via Kanban tag system

---

### 🔄 Continuous Improvement

#### 🔁 Feedback Loop

- Instructor feedback incorporated via comments
- Self-assessment log after each milestone (via `Reflections.md`)
- Viewer input (if posted) tracked and noted in `Devlog Review.md`

#### 🔧 Adaptation and Evolution

- Task templates are updated with QA lessons
- YAML headers revised with custom QA fields if gaps are identified

---

### 🗃️ Documentation and Record Keeping

#### 📝 Quality Records

| Record Type              | Location                                         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Schematic DRC Reports    | Attached to CD-T03 + saved as PDF               |
| Joint Test Notes         | Logged in PD-T07 + `Test Logs.md`               |
| Obsidian Vault Compliance| `Vault Schema Compliance.md`                    |
