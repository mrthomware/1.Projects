# 🧰 Resource Allocation Plan

- **Resource Usage**: Detailed plan for resource allocation and management.

---
A Resource Allocation Plan is vital for the efficient and effective execution of the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, ensuring all hardware, software, financial, and personal resources are used at the right time, in the right place, and for the right purpose. This document outlines a full strategy for managing these resources across all four major project parts.

## 🧾 Resource Allocation Plan for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 🎯 Introduction

- **Purpose of the Plan**:  
  This plan ensures optimal usage of resources across Controller Design, Puppet Fabrication, Show Pipeline, and Obsidian Vault documentation. It aligns resource availability with each task’s schedule and complexity to prevent bottlenecks, underutilization, or burnout.

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Human Resources**        | Thomas Ware (solo developer), academic mentors (feedback only)          |
| **Material Resources**     | Servos, microcontrollers, 3D printing filament, puppet fabric, solder   |
| **Technological Resources**| KiCad, VS Code, ElevenLabs, Obsidian, Blender, multimeter, soldering iron |
| **Financial Resources**    | $400 personal budget (tracked via Obsidian + receipts)                  |
| **Information Resources**  | MCU datasheets, servo manuals, puppet modeling guides, templates        |

### 📋 Resource Allocation Strategy

#### ⚖️ Allocation Criteria
- **Task Priority** (Controller before Puppet before Pipeline)
- **Resource Readiness** (tools must be available before assigned)
- **Skill Match** (technical tasks scheduled around solo dev strengths)

#### 🧠 Human Resources

| Task Range   | Assigned To  | Rationale                                   |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| CD-T01–CD-T14| Thomas Ware  | PCB design, firmware writing, debugging     |
| PD-T01–PD-T12| Thomas Ware  | CAD modeling, 3D printing, joint testing    |
| SP-T01–SP-T14| Thomas Ware  | Audio scripting, animatronic sync, editing  |
| OV-T01–OV-T08| Thomas Ware  | Obsidian PARA vault creation, task tracking |

#### 🧪 Material & Technological Resources

| Tool / Material          | Assigned Phase             | Usage Window       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| RP2040, resistors, PCB   | Controller Development      | CD-T03–CD-T07      |
| Servo Motors (x6)        | Puppet Development          | PD-T03–PD-T10      |
| 3D Printer + Filament    | Puppet Frame + Skull Design | PD-T02–PD-T04      |
| ElevenLabs API + Blender | Show Pipeline Development   | SP-T02–SP-T07      |

#### 💵 Financial Resources

| Budget Category      | Amount (CAD) | Allocation Target                        |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| PCB Prototyping      | $75          | CD-T05                                   |
| Servo/Electronics    | $150         | PD-T03, CD-T06                           |
| Puppet Fabrication   | $100         | PD-T04, PD-T06                           |
| Voiceover Tools      | $30          | SP-T03                                   |
| Contingency          | $45          | Any stage delays or sourcing changes     |

### 📈 Monitoring and Adjustments

#### 🕵️‍♂️ Tracking Usage

- Resource status logged in:
  - `Resource Management.md`
  - `Budget Tracking.md`
  - Task YAML `resources_allocated` fields

#### 📆 Regular Review

| Frequency      | Trigger                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Bi-weekly      | Scheduled during solo review days  |
| Milestone Hit  | Resource audit + forward planning  |
| Scope Change   | Reviewed during `Change Records.md`|

#### 🔄 Adjustment Mechanisms

- Realign tasks if component delays occur.
- Pause tasks if material/tool access blocked.
- Document substitutions or reallocation in vault.

---

### 🚀 Resource Optimization

#### 📉 Efficiency Measures

- Design-first workflows (e.g., block diagram before schematic)
- Group print jobs and soldering tasks to save setup time
- Use free versions of software tools when feasible

#### ⚠️ Risk Management

| Risk                        | Mitigation                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Servo inventory shortage    | Order extra units during PCB delivery window     |
| 3D printer failure          | Use manual cutting backup for low-stress parts   |
| Voiceover token limits      | Prioritize main scenes, reuse assets creatively  |
