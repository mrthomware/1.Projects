The **Change Management Documentation** for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** outlines procedures for managing all changes across scope, timeline, or resources. In a solo developer setting with strict sequential task flow, maintaining a transparent and structured record of changes ensures continuity, traceability, and minimal disruption.

### 📋 Change Management Process

#### 📨 Request Process

- Change requests are initiated via internal task reflection or triggered during milestone reviews.
- Changes must be logged before implementation, except in cases of emergency (logged retroactively).

#### 🔍 Evaluation & Approval

- **Review Owner**: Thomas Ware (solo developer authority)
- **Criteria for Approval**:
  - Must resolve a blocker or improve system efficiency.
  - Must not compromise quality or long-term maintainability.
  - Must fit within allowable buffer time.

#### 🔧 Implementation

- Approved changes update:
  - Task Register (`Tasks - Note.md`)
  - Affected phase documents (e.g., CD-T07 for firmware)
  - Milestone dates (only if impact analysis supports it)
- Tracked in `Change Records.md` with reference to affected task IDs.

---

### 📣 Communication of Changes

#### 🗂 Internal Communication

- Logged changes are reviewed weekly as part of the Solo Developer Review ritual (Sunday night vault sync).
- Cross-linked to project overview board for visibility.

#### 📤 Stakeholder Notification

- Critical changes (e.g., milestone delays or phase redefinition) summarized in `Progress Updates.md` and exported as PDF for instructor/adviser if required.

---

### 🔁 Regular Review and Auditing

#### ⏰ Review Schedule

- Full change log reviewed after each milestone completion
- Any unresolved "Pending" changes escalated for solo review

#### ✅ Audit Process

- All completed changes tagged in Obsidian and included in a mid-project audit
- Audits check for traceability from change ID → task → milestone → outcome

---

### ✅ Conclusion

Effective change control ensures the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** remains realistic, transparent, and adaptable. Every documented change preserves the integrity of the timeline, task flow, and stakeholder trust—even under resource-constrained, solo execution.
