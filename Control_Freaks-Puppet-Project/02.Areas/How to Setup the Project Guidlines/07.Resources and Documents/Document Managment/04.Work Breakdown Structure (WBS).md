# 🧩 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- **Visualization**: Breakdown of project scope into manageable sections.

---
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a core tool for organizing the scope of the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**. It breaks the entire effort into clear, actionable parts across the four major project areas, allowing detailed tracking and assignment of every deliverable.

## 📌 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 🧭 Introduction

- **Purpose of WBS**:  
  The WBS provides a structured decomposition of all work necessary to complete the project. It enables focused task assignment, transparent progress tracking, and seamless alignment with scheduling, budgeting, and documentation requirements across the **four key project parts**.

### 🧾 WBS Dictionary

Each task within the WBS includes the following standardized information:

| ID      | Task Title                          | Responsible | Description                                                              | Est. Duration |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| CD-T01  | Draft Servo Control Block Diagram    | T. Ware     | Define signal flow, control logic, and input/output mapping              | 2 days         |
| PD-T04  | 3D Print Puppet Skeleton Components  | T. Ware     | Print all modular parts required for skeleton assembly                   | 2 days         |
| SP-T07  | Capture Animatronic Movements        | T. Ware     | Record servo-driven puppet acting to synced audio                        | 3 days         |
| OV-T06  | Review Logs and Audit Documentation  | T. Ware     | Ensure milestone reviews, risks, notes, and buffers are fully captured   | 1 day          |

*(Full dictionary entries are available per task in their respective markdown files.)*

### 🔗 Integration with Project Plan

- Every WBS element aligns with:
  - Task IDs (e.g., `CD-T03`, `PD-T08`)
  - Milestones (e.g., schematic approval, show release)
  - Timeline (strictly sequential solo workflow)
  - Resource and budget allocations from the Project Plan

WBS structure supports traceability from high-level goals to fine-grained actions.

---

### 🔁 Monitoring and Updating

- **Review Cycle**: Every 2 weeks during development or after major milestone.
- **Update Mechanism**: Use Obsidian notes tied to each WBS node via backlinks and status flags.
- **Version Control**: WBS revisions are tracked in `Change Records.md` with dates and justifications.

---

### 🛠️ Usage in Project Management

#### ✅ Task Assignment and Management
- WBS forms the backbone of the **Task Register**, **Kanban Board**, and **Gantt Timeline**
- Used to assign, filter, and prioritize tasks across development stages

#### ⚠️ Risk and Quality Management
- Tasks tagged for risk exposure or quality gates in the WBS are flagged for review
- Buffers and critical checkpoints are mapped directly to WBS entries

---

The **WBS for Control Freaks Puppet Project** ensures that each component of this solo-developed technical and creative venture is defined, traceable, and actionable. It enables granular progress tracking, budget control, and milestone alignment—while keeping all work visible and verifiable through the Obsidian PARA vault.
