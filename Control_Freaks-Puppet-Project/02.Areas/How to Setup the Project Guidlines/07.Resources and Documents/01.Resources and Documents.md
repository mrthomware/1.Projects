# 📦 Project Resource and Document Management Plan – Control Freaks Puppet Project

Effective management of resources and documentation is foundational to the success of the *Control Freaks Puppet Project*. This plan ensures all resources are tracked, all documents are maintained accurately, and project operations remain organized, timely, and efficient.

## 🔧 Resource Management

### 👤 Human Resources

- **Team Members**: Thomas Ware (Solo Developer), with potential future collaborators in fabrication, editing, and performance.
- **Task Allocation**: Based on role segmentation (engineering, animation, documentation, testing, etc.) within the Obsidian Task Registry.
- **Skills and Training**: Includes microcontroller programming, CAD modeling, puppet fabrication, servo calibration, and production documentation.

### 💰 Financial Resources

- **Budget Overview**: Funded via student grants, personal loans, and income from part-time employment.
- **Cost Tracking**: Tracked in QuickBooks and Obsidian Financial Ledger; includes parts, software licenses, prototyping tools, and fabrication costs.

### 🛠 Material Resources

- **Materials List**:
  - Servo motors
  - Microcontrollers
  - 3D printing filament and hardware
  - Power supplies and breakout boards
  - Puppet foam and skin materials

- **Usage Plan**: Stored in resource inventory tables in `/Resources/Control Freaks Hardware`. All materials logged and usage reviewed per milestone.

### 🧠 Information Resources

- **Data Sources**:
  - ABB Robotics Courseware (for animation logic)
  - S7-1200 documentation
  - Online servo motion libraries and design reference guides

- **Access Plan**: Documented links and reference files in the Obsidian Vault, tagged via `#reference` and grouped in the `Resources/References` folder.

### ⏱ Time Management

- **Timeline**: Defined in the Project Gantt chart (`/Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/Documentation/Timeline.md`).
- **Progress Monitoring**: Weekly solo sprint retrospectives logged in the Daily Notes Vault; milestone reviews per month.

## 🗂 Document Management

### 📋 Project Plan

- **Details**: Central roadmap defining scope, objectives, tasks, timelines, and resource needs. Located at `/Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/Documentation/Project Plan.md`.

### 💼 Business Case

- **Justification**: Outlines the long-term value of open-source puppet automation for the Control Freaks brand and YouTube content strategy.

### 🧱 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- **Visualization**: Mermaid-based WBS charts breaking down tasks across Controller, Puppet, and Show Development phases.

### 📊 Gantt Chart

- **Schedule Representation**: Mermaid Gantt format defines duration, start/end dates, and task dependencies.

### ⚠ Risk Management Plan

- **Risk Assessment**: Tracks technical, timing, and budget risks using checklists in `/Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/Risk Register.md`.

### 📡 Communication Plan

- **Communication Strategy**: Internal notes logged in Obsidian. External updates managed via GitHub project board and YouTube community posts.

### 🔄 Resource Allocation Plan

- **Resource Usage**: Tasks mapped to each internal role (solo developer by function), defining when and how each resource is used.

### 📝 Change Management Documentation

- **Change Records**: All scope, hardware, or software adjustments logged in `/Projects/.../Change Log.md` with rationale and impact analysis.

### 🧾 Meeting Minutes and Reports

- **Meeting Documentation**: Solo development journal logs, milestone reviews, and planning summaries.

### ✅ Quality Management Plan

- **Quality Standards**: Servo motion tolerance: ±200 analog units. Audio sync accuracy goal: < 50ms lag.

### 👥 Stakeholder Register

- **Stakeholder Information**: Currently only Thomas Ware. Placeholder for future collaborators or sponsors.

### 💸 Budget Documents

- **Financial Details**: Tracked in QuickBooks with cross-linked summaries in Obsidian `/Projects/.../Budget Report.md`.

### 📄 Procurement Documents

- **Contracts and Agreements**: Receipts and orders stored in `/Archives/Procurement/` with YAML metadata per item.

### 📘 Closure Report

- **Project Summary**: To be completed at project end; will contain performance metrics, challenges faced, lessons learned, and final design release details.

---

### 📌 Notes

- This plan should be reviewed **bi-weekly** and updated after each milestone.
- All related files are tracked and tagged for retrieval using `#resource-plan`, `#doc-mgmt`, and `#cfpuppet-project`.
