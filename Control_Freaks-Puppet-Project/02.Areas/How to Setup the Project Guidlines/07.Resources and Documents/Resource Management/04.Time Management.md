## Time Management for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### üóìÔ∏è Timeline

- **Project Schedule Overview**:
  - **Milestone Chart**:
    - Defined across four sequential project phases:
      1. **Controller Development**
      2. **Puppet Development**
      3. **Show Pipeline Development**
      4. **Obsidian Vault Integration**
    - Each phase includes clear milestone targets with due dates documented in the `Milestones.md` file and `Gantt Timeline.md`.

  - **Detailed Task Schedule**:
    - Tasks are identified by code (`CD-T##`, `PD-T##`, etc.) and listed in sequential order within the Task Register.
    - Each task includes:
      - Start/End Dates
      - Duration in days
      - Dependencies (strictly sequential, solo developer constraint)
      - Tracked within the Mermaid Gantt Chart

- **Integration with Resource Planning**:
  - Timeline is synchronized with availability of:
    - Materials (procurement deadlines)
    - Tools (MakerSpace booking for fabrication)
    - Solo development bandwidth (max 6 hrs/day average)
    - Financial pacing of prototyping costs

### üìä Progress Monitoring

- **Tracking Methods**:
  - **Obsidian Kanban Plugin**:
    - Status columns: `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Blocked`, `Completed`
    - Custom properties: `Task Code`, `Phase`, `Duration`, `Date Created`, `Status`
  - **Mermaid Gantt Chart**:
    - Continuously updated to reflect actual progress
    - Visual mapping of sequential execution
  - **Dataview Queries**:
    - Query open/overdue/completed tasks
    - Daily/weekly summary embeds in daily notes

- **Regular Status Meetings**:
  - Solo end-of-week self-review:
    - Conducted every Sunday evening
    - Use ‚ÄúWeekly Review‚Äù template
    - Captures: progress vs. plan, blockers, and next week‚Äôs targets

- **Reporting**:
  - **Progress Reports**:
    - Stored in `/04.Archive/Weekly Progress Logs/`
    - Include task completion logs, delays, blocker notes
  - **KPIs and Metrics**:
    - Task throughput (tasks/week)
    - Time variance (planned vs. actual)
    - Idle task days
    - % milestone completion

- **Adjustments and Flexibility**:
  - **Contingency Planning**:
    - 15% buffer added between phase transitions
    - Rain days included for MakerSpace access or burnout
  - **Change Management**:
    - All schedule changes logged in `Change Management Documentation`
    - Schedule deviations flagged in Kanban and noted in weekly review

### üë§ Team Time Management

- **Individual Workloads**:
  - One-task-at-a-time policy enforced
  - Daily limit of 1‚Äì2 hours focused build time during school semester
  - Burnout prevention enforced through non-punitive slip recognition

- **Time Management Training**:
  - Weekly self-study on time-blocking, priority matrix (Eisenhower)
  - Training notes embedded in `/03.Resources/Skill Building/Time Management.md`

---

Effective time management in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** ensures that solo development proceeds without burnout, delays are absorbed with buffer periods, and every phase flows into the next with deliberate pacing and reflection. Tools like Kanban, Gantt, and Dataview make the timeline both visible and adaptable.
