## Information Resources Management for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources

- **Internal Project Vault**:
  - `Control Freaks Vault` ‚Äì Obsidian-based PKM system structured by the PARA method. Includes all documentation, research, schematics, meeting logs, and test results.
  - Key file locations:
    - `/01.Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/`
    - `/02.Areas/Animatronics Knowledgebase/`
    - `/03.Resources/Component Specs/`
    - `/04.Archives/Prototype Iterations/`

- **Libraries & Archives**:
  - UFV Library eResources: Access to JSTOR, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect (student credentials).
  - MakerSpace Physical Archives: Onsite documentation and tutorials from faculty advisors and previous capstone projects.

- **Industry-Specific Sources**:
  - **Adafruit Learn System**: Servo and motion control articles.
  - **SparkFun Tech Guides**: Controller boards, H-bridge chips, microcontroller interfacing.
  - **ABB Robotics** (for industrial comparison studies).
  - **Siemens TIA Portal Docs**: For learning structured logic parallel to puppet motion sequencing.

- **Online Communities & Forums**:
  - **r/Animatronics**, **r/robotics**, and **r/PLC** ‚Äì Forums used for advice and technical problem-solving.
  - YouTube channels: **Adam Savage‚Äôs Tested**, **Control Freaks YouTube Drafts**, **Blender Guru**, and **Hackaday**.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ Training and Support

- **Vault Navigation Training**:
  - Weekly journal entries in Obsidian will include cross-linking practice
  - Vault map created using `Dataview` and `Map of Content (MOC)` notes

- **Platform Literacy**:
  - Research techniques logged in `Research Guide.md`
  - Tutorial walkthroughs for GitHub, JSTOR, and technical forums stored in:
    `/03.Resources/Platform Usage Guides/`

---

### ü§ù Information Sharing & Collaboration

- **Collaboration Platforms**:
  - GitHub Discussions for project branching
  - Email archive for correspondence with instructors, suppliers, and testers

- **Central Repository**:
  - `/01.Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/00_Master_Reference.md` as a centralized index
  - All deliverables, reference images, and logbooks organized by phase

---

### üîí Compliance and Security

- **Data Privacy**:
  - No personal data shared publicly in vault or GitHub
  - MakerSpace compliance agreements stored in `Legal_Agreements.md`

- **Confidentiality**:
  - External contributors asked to sign informal NDA if collaborative design is involved
  - Critical files (e.g., control schematics) stored locally with encrypted backups

---

### üìä Monitoring and Updates

- **Relevance Review**:
  - Quarterly review of sources for redundancy, accuracy, or updates
  - Deprecated files moved to `/04.Archives/Obsolete References/`

- **Access Review**:
  - Audit of file sharing settings in Drive and GitHub every month
  - GitHub commit log monitored weekly to track edits and repo access

---

Effective management of information resources in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** guarantees timely access to validated data and research, which supports high-quality decision-making and design integrity. This information ecosystem is maintained and optimized as the project evolves.
