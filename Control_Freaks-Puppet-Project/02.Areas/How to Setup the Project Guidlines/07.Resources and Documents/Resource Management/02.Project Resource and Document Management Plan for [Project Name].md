# Project Resource and Document Management Plan for Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

## 🧰 Resource Management

### 👤 Human Resources

- **Team Members**:  
  - Thomas Ware – Solo Developer (Design, Fabrication, Firmware, Storytelling)  
  - ChatGPT (Co-Pilot) – PM assistant, script assistant, technical aide  
  - MakerSpace Resources – Ad hoc support (equipment access, consultation)

- **Task Allocation**:  
  - Tasks are assigned strictly sequentially across 4 core phases (Controller, Puppet, Pipeline, Vault).  
  - Each task is tracked using Obsidian's Kanban and linked to the Gantt chart.

- **Skills and Training**:  
  - PCB design, servo control, 3D CAD, puppet construction, Obsidian workflows.  
  - Training self-directed, supported by logged learning resources in `/03.Resources/`.

---

### 💸 Financial Resources

- **Budget Overview**:  
  - Budget Range: **$500 – $750 CAD**  
  - Funded via personal income and part-time employment.  
  - Categories: electronics, tools, puppet materials, prototyping, testing.

- **Cost Tracking**:  
  - Maintained in Obsidian under `Project Budget.md`.  
  - Monitored via manually-updated expense logs and receipts.

---

### 🧱 Material Resources

- **Materials List**:  
  - Servo motors, microcontroller boards, 3D printer filament, puppet fabric, soldering tools.

- **Usage Plan**:  
  - Parts are staged based on project phase and ordered only when needed.  
  - Prototyping spares and fabrication parts logged for future reuse.

---

### 📚 Information Resources

- **Data Sources**:  
  - Manufacturer datasheets, servo datasheets, Obsidian plugin documentation, YouTube guides.  
  - Puppet references from sketchbooks and design guides in `/03.Resources/References/`.

- **Access Plan**:  
  - Centralized in Obsidian vault with live backlinks, YAML headers, and Dataview queries.  
  - Secure, version-controlled vault kept updated weekly.

---

### ⏳ Time Management

- **Timeline**:  
  - Fully sequential Gantt schedule across:
    1. **Controller Development**
    2. **Puppet Development**
    3. **Show Pipeline Development**
    4. **Obsidian Vault Integration**

- **Progress Monitoring**:  
  - Obsidian Kanban boards  
  - Weekly status check-ins  
  - Milestone reviews logged at defined checkpoints

## 🗂️ Document Management

### 📘 Project Plan

- Captures project goals, scope, timelines, key phases, major deliverables, and review points.

### 💼 Business Case

- Justifies value of solo puppet + animatronics system for YouTube education and content creation.

### 🧱 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Tasks broken down by phase and prefixed with phase codes (CD-T##, PD-T##, etc.)

### 📊 Gantt Chart

- Visual task flow using Mermaid syntax. Shows strict sequence with defined durations and dependencies.

### ⚠️ Risk Management Plan

- Identifies technical, budgetary, timeline, and fabrication risks.  
- Each risk includes impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategy.

### 📣 Communication Plan

- Solo workflow + stakeholder (YouTube, viewers, mentors).  
- Regular self-logging, progress reports stored in `Meeting Minutes.md`.

### ⚙️ Resource Allocation Plan

- Tracks material use, human hours, task handoffs, and budget flow in Obsidian tables.

### 🔄 Change Management Documentation

- All scope, timeline, or phase deviations logged in `Change Log.md` in PARA vault.

### 📋 Meeting Minutes and Reports

- Internal logs for design reviews, phase transition status, and task audits.  
- Formatted markdown entries stored under `/07.Resources and Documents/Meetings/`.

### 🧪 Quality Management Plan

- QA gates after key tasks (PCB design, servo test, puppet movement).  
- Logs are stored in each task file, with YAML `status` and `review` fields.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Stakeholder Register

- Stakeholders:
  - Thomas Ware (Developer/Director/Builder)
  - Control Freaks Audience (YouTube viewers)
  - MakerLab (resource contributor)

### 💰 Budget Documents

- Summary and breakdowns in `/07.Resources and Documents/Project Budget.md`.

### 📑 Procurement Documents

- Quotes, invoices, receipts from suppliers (e.g., servos, filament, PCBs) in `Receipts` folder.

### 📓 Closure Report

- Final review of milestones, quality, team reflection, and lessons learned will be stored in `Closure.md`.
