## 📊 Business Analyst – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

In the Control Freaks Puppet Project, the **Business Analyst** acts as the bridge between technical execution (controller design, puppet mechanics, automation logic) and the real-world goals of the project: educational value, content creation, scalability for future puppets, and resource sustainability. This role ensures that design decisions align with the project's strategic, creative, and educational intent.

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 📥 Requirements Gathering
- Captures specific needs from:
  - Educational goals (e.g., puppet must demonstrate servo-timing synchrony for students)
  - Creative objectives (e.g., character expressiveness, lip-sync, modular rigging)
  - Technical boundaries (e.g., what can be done with off-the-shelf servos or PCB space constraints)
- Uses informal interviews, journaling, and milestone reflections to document evolving needs.

#### 🧠 Requirements Analysis
- Prioritizes core features (e.g., motion precision, safety for classroom handling) over secondary ones (e.g., onboard audio playback).
- Identifies feasibility blockers, like voltage rail limits or footprint constraints for breadboard prototyping.

#### 🧩 Solution Alignment
- Validates each technical decision (e.g., moving from PWM to I2C servo control) against initial objectives:
  - Cost
  - Repeatability
  - Educational clarity
- Flags scope creep when tech experimentation veers away from practical deployment.

#### 🗂️ Documentation
- Maintains requirement logs, technical notes, and constraints tracking in Obsidian:
  - Example: A single YAML-linked vault entry documents motor stall current, PCB trace width calculation, and thermal limits in one note.
- Creates alignment matrices when evaluating options (e.g., choosing between PCA9685 and ATmega328 for PWM generation).

#### 🔄 Communication
- Translates engineering goals into audience-facing language for:
  - YouTube descriptions
  - Grant funding proposals
  - School presentations
- Summarizes trade-offs between features for stakeholders (even if the stakeholder is a future self reviewing vault archives).

#### 🔁 Change Management Support
- Works closely with the Change Manager to analyze whether feature additions or deletions affect user goals or long-term plans.
- Ensures each new requirement is logged with a reason and timestamp.

#### ✅ Quality Assurance Support
- Verifies that delivered subsystems (e.g., controller board or puppet faceplate) meet original needs.
- Conducts usability reviews:
  - Can a novice replicate the build?
  - Is the wiring labeled clearly?
  - Is firmware readable, maintainable?

### 🧾 Project Context

As a solo developer, the role of Business Analyst might seem redundant—but it’s vital. It forces discipline in separating **what is cool** from **what is necessary**, anchoring each design choice in project objectives, budget, and learning impact. It turns tinkering into strategic iteration.
