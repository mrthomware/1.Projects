## 🔄 Change Manager – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

The **Change Manager** in the Control Freaks Puppet Project plays a critical role in ensuring that all modifications to designs, schedules, budgets, or requirements are carefully assessed, documented, and implemented without disrupting the solo developer's flow or derailing the larger vision.

---

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 🗃️ Change Request Management
- Acts as the centralized contact for all internal project changes:
  - PCB layout revisions
  - Fabrication tool swaps (e.g., SLA vs. FDM printing)
  - Firmware logic rewrites or feature additions
- Logs, tracks, and archives each change request for traceability.

#### ⚖️ Impact Assessment
- Evaluates how proposed changes affect:
  - Build timelines and sequencing (e.g., delays due to design iteration)
  - Budget (e.g., purchasing higher-grade servos or new test tools)
  - Dependencies between controller and puppet hardware
- Uses a lightweight risk matrix for impact classification.

#### 🧩 Decision Facilitation
- Simulates or documents scenarios to guide decision-making, especially for:
  - Trade-offs between quality vs. deadline
  - Whether to skip a test stage for time-saving
- Advises solo developer (Thomas Ware) with summary notes to make informed go/no-go decisions.

#### 📣 Stakeholder Communication
- Documents all accepted/rejected change decisions in:
  - Obsidian Change Log
  - Git commit logs (when hardware design files or firmware are versioned)
  - Progress reports for YouTube/educational sharing

#### 🔗 Integration of Changes
- Works closely with the Project Manager (same individual in this case) to:
  - Update the build sequence in the Gantt chart
  - Adjust component sourcing schedule
  - Realign documentation or labeling (e.g., if pinouts change)

#### 📊 Monitoring and Reporting
- Tracks whether approved changes deliver intended outcomes:
  - Logs pass/fail results from tests post-change
  - Compares new prototype results against baselines
- Reports outcomes in milestone review notes.

#### 🛡️ Risk Management
- Assesses risks of:
  - Over-customization during firmware prototyping
  - Mid-scope expansion leading to scope creep
- Adds flags to tasks that trigger cascading changes.

#### 🧠 Training and Adaptation
- Updates technical documentation for new components or software libraries.
- Adjusts task instructions when process or tool changes affect execution (e.g., swapping PCB fab services or CAD library updates).

### 🧾 Project Context

Given that this is a **solo-developed**, hardware-intensive prototyping project, change management is crucial not only for keeping costs and time under control but also for learning from iteration cycles. Even small changes can cause downstream disruptions — this role ensures they are always tracked, justified, and implemented with full context.
