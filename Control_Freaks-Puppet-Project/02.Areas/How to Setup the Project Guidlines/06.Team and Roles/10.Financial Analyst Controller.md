## 💵 Financial Analyst/Controller – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

In a solo-developed hardware-software project like **Control Freaks**, the Financial Analyst/Controller role is vital for managing a constrained budget, prioritizing purchases, and tracking cash flow across all phases — especially in hardware procurement and iterative fabrication.

---

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 🧾 Budget Management
- Drafts and maintains the project budget, allocating funds across:
  - **Electronics** (PCB manufacturing, servos, controller ICs)
  - **Fabrication** (3D filament, printing fees, adhesives, resins)
  - **Tooling & Test Gear** (multimeter, soldering kits, test rigs)
- Adjusts allocations dynamically based on test failures or redesigns.

#### 💳 Expense Tracking
- Maintains detailed records of:
  - Purchases (itemized with vendor receipts)
  - Personal cash contributions and refunds
  - Software and cloud service subscriptions (if applicable for testing or simulation tools)
- Tracks discrepancies between planned vs. actual spending.

#### 📊 Financial Reporting
- Generates:
  - **Monthly budget snapshots**
  - **Phase-end reports** after Controller Prototyping, Puppet Assembly, and Show Pipeline integration.
- Highlights overspending trends or opportunities to repurpose funds (e.g., reusing prototype parts).

#### 📉 Cost Analysis
- Evaluates:
  - Whether higher-cost components improved performance or reliability.
  - ROI of fabrication methods (e.g., resin vs. PLA prints).
- Analyzes failed iterations (e.g., burnt PCB) to determine root cost impact.

#### 🔮 Financial Forecasting
- Forecasts upcoming material and tool needs based on:
  - Gantt timeline durations
  - Technical design stages
- Builds rolling forecasts for each major task bucket:
  - PCB rounds
  - Puppet joint iterations
  - Audio pipeline hardware costs

#### ✅ Compliance and Audit
- Ensures:
  - Clear separation of business vs. personal expenses.
  - All asset purchases logged for potential tax deductions under prototyping tools or R&D.

#### 🚨 Risk Management
- Identifies financial risks like:
  - Servo stockouts requiring expensive substitutions
  - Tool failure mid-fabrication (e.g., nozzle or extruder jams)
- Maintains a **budget buffer** per milestone for such events.

#### 🗣️ Stakeholder Communication
- Prepares budget summaries for:
  - School presentations
  - Grant applications
  - YouTube transparency (e.g., “How much did the puppet cost?” episode)

### 🧾 Project Context

For a one-person, time-constrained, physical build project like this, financial oversight must be lightweight yet meticulous. This role ensures every dollar is mapped to a prototype output, while providing traceability for iteration costs and future budgeting accuracy.
