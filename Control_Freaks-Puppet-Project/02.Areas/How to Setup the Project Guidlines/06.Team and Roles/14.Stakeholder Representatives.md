## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Stakeholder Representatives – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

In the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, Stakeholder Representatives serve as the conduit between the solo developer and the broader audience, including mentors, content viewers, academic supervisors, and technical peers. Since the project spans technical engineering, artistic storytelling, and public content delivery (YouTube), aligning expectations and gathering multi-dimensional feedback is essential for project relevance and impact.

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 🗣️ Voice of Stakeholder Groups
- Represent specific stakeholder interests:
  - **YouTube audience**: entertainment, accessibility, behind-the-scenes transparency.
  - **Academic advisors**: technical documentation, educational value, learning outcomes.
  - **Makerspace community or mentors**: replicability, engineering creativity, innovation.
- Ensure these perspectives inform design, build, and content publishing decisions.

#### 📝 Gathering Input and Feedback
- Use structured channels:
  - Comment summaries and reaction tracking from YouTube.
  - Mid-phase reviews with school mentors or instructors.
  - Peer feedback from maker forums or Discord groups.
- Facilitate periodic reflection sessions (via journaling or survey forms) to distill key stakeholder sentiments.

#### 📋 Requirement Communication
- Translate qualitative stakeholder inputs into actionable requirements:
  - e.g., “Make the puppet more expressive for camera” → Add eyebrow servo.
  - “Include cost breakdowns” → Publish BOM (Bill of Materials).

#### 🔄 Change Communication
- Communicate updates and scope shifts back to stakeholder groups using:
  - Markdown update notes
  - YouTube captions/posts
  - Academic reporting summaries
- Provide rationale for major decisions (e.g., changing from analog to I2C control).

#### 🔁 Feedback Loop Creation
- Maintain an iterative communication cycle:
  - Input → Implementation → Response → Improvement
- Ensure all major phases include a “feedback capture + reflect” checkpoint.

#### ⚖️ Conflict Resolution
- Where feedback conflicts (e.g., “make it simpler” vs “make it more impressive”), help synthesize compromises:
  - Add modular layers: base puppet vs advanced features for enthusiasts.

#### 💡 Advisory Role
- Offer insights on:
  - Viewer retention strategies for content delivery.
  - Educational value maximization for course-related goals.
  - Scalability or replication concerns for maker communities.

#### 🤝 Engagement and Support
- Actively encourage and maintain interest from various groups:
  - Announce builds-in-progress
  - Share sketches, prototypes, and early failures for transparency
  - Acknowledge feedback integration visibly in outputs
