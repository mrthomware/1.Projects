# 🎯 Project Objectives and Goals – Control Freaks Vault

This project is organized around **four integrated development domains**, each defined with clear SMART goals to guide execution, review, and outcomes:

---

## 🧠 1. Controller Development

### ✅ Objective: Design and Build a Custom Puppet Control System with Audio-Synced Servo Firmware

- **Specific**: Develop a standalone controller board using an ESP32 microcontroller with firmware capable of executing audio-triggered motion sequences via PWM signals across multiple servo channels.
- **Measurable**: Sub-50ms motion-to-audio response time; 100% operational consistency across 5 test sequences.
- **Achievable**: Use KiCad for schematic/PCB design and Arduino/VS Code for firmware programming.
- **Relevant**: Forms the technical foundation for all puppet actuation and synchronized performance.
- **Time-bound**: Complete board fabrication, firmware testing, and debugging by **September 9, 2025**.

## 🤖 2. Puppet Development

### ✅ Objective: Build a Fully Functional, Motion-Calibrated Animatronic Puppet

- **Specific**: Construct a servo-integrated puppet head and face system using 3D printing and hand-built articulation mechanisms capable of executing scripted motions.
- **Measurable**: Puppet successfully completes a 10-motion cue sequence with <5% positional error over 3 repetitions.
- **Achievable**: Leverage Fusion 360, accessible PLA filament, micro servos, and foam materials on hand.
- **Relevant**: Provides the physical interface for all motion-captured and character-driven performances.
- **Time-bound**: Fully assembled, calibrated, and ready for filming by **October 22, 2025**.

## 🎬 3. Show Pipeline Development

### ✅ Objective: Produce and Publish a Scripted Demo Episode Using the Animatronic Puppet

- **Specific**: Write, cue, shoot, edit, and render a 3–5 minute short scene featuring the puppet in scripted dialogue with synchronized movements.
- **Measurable**: Final video exported and successfully uploaded to YouTube with playback verification.
- **Achievable**: Use existing DSLR, USB audio interface, OBS Studio, and DaVinci Resolve for post-production.
- **Relevant**: Demonstrates functional integration of all technical components in a narrative format.
- **Time-bound**: Publish by **November 19, 2025**.

## 🗂️ 4. Obsidian Vault Integration

### ✅ Objective: Fully Automate and Document the Project Pipeline Inside Obsidian

- **Specific**: Use Obsidian to track task progress, automate note creation (via Templater), generate Gantt views (via Mermaid/Dataview), and embed cue logs and code commits throughout the vault.
- **Measurable**: Each task and milestone documented in YAML metadata and tracked across 4 project areas.
- **Achievable**: Leverages current PARA-aligned vault setup and tested plugins already installed.
- **Relevant**: Ensures the system is repeatable, auditable, and shareable for future animatronic work.
- **Time-bound**: Integration and documentation finalized by **December 8, 2025**.
