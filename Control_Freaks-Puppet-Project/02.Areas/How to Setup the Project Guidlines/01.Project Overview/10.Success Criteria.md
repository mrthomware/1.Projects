# ✅ Success Criteria – Control Freaks Vault

This document defines clear, measurable indicators for success across **four integrated areas** of the *Control Freaks Vault* solo development project:

1. 🎛 Controller Development  
2. 🤖 Puppet Development  
3. 🎬 YouTube Channel Development  
4. 🗃 Obsidian Workflow Integration  

---

## 🎛 1. Controller Development

### 📏 **Criteria: Audio-Motion Synchronization Accuracy**

- **Description**: Controller firmware must trigger puppet movements within 50ms of pre-defined audio cues for believable lip-sync.
- **Measurement**: Compare motion logs and audio timestamps from test scripts.
- **Target**: ≤ **50ms average latency** over **3 test runs** using complete gesture/audio script.

---

### ⚙️ **Criteria: Modular Code & Reusability**

- **Description**: Firmware must support character profiles and interchangeable motion libraries.
- **Measurement**: Successful execution of 3 motion profiles across test puppets.
- **Target**: ≥ **3 modular profiles** with selectable control sets via command interface.

---

## 🤖 2. Puppet Development

### 🧠 **Criteria: Motion Repeatability and Physical Integrity**

- **Description**: Puppet must perform a 10-action scripted sequence five times without motion variance or hardware failure.
- **Measurement**: Manual and logged motion test using calibrated triggers.
- **Target**: ≥ **95% positional consistency**, 0 major component failures.

---

### 🔩 **Criteria: Assembly and Mechanical Range Verification**

- **Description**: Final puppet must demonstrate designed range for head, jaw, and eye movement.
- **Measurement**: Motion checklist during scripted full-range cycle.
- **Target**: All three axes function with intended mechanical range and stable returns.

---

## 🎬 3. YouTube Channel Development

### 🎥 **Criteria: Pilot Episode Completion & Public Feedback**

- **Description**: Publish a 3–5 minute pilot episode that demonstrates puppet animation with synchronized voiceover.
- **Measurement**: Confirm video upload, comment count, and playback quality.
- **Target**: **1 video** uploaded + ≥ **5 audience interactions** (comments/likes) on animation/technical aspects.

---

### 📹 **Criteria: Behind-the-Scenes Educational Clip**

- **Description**: Deliver a 3–4 minute breakdown video detailing project stages, puppetry logic, and technical implementation.
- **Measurement**: Check for completion and educational clarity.
- **Target**: Complete feature uploaded alongside pilot with basic editing and subtitles.

---

## 🗃 4. Obsidian Workflow Integration

### 🧰 **Criteria: Integrated Build and Script Logs**

- **Description**: Obsidian must include a working storyboard canvas and synchronized controller script logs.
- **Measurement**: Functional canvas with gesture tags, Dataview queries for script-task linkage.
- **Target**: ≥ **1 storyboard canvas** + linked motion/audio events per script.

---

### 📚 **Criteria: Documentation & Knowledge Archive**

- **Description**: All core steps must be captured in markdown/PDF for future reproducibility.
- **Measurement**: Vault contains logs, calibration data, firmware explanation, and motion design logic.
- **Target**: All deliverables documented and stored in `Project_Management` and `Assets/Docs/`.

---

## 📦 5. Deliverables Completion Check

- **Description**: Confirm successful completion of all deliverables from the [04.Key Deliverables](04.Key%20Deliverables.md) document.
- **Measurement**: Manual checklist of physical builds, motion test logs, script completion, and video assets.
- **Target**: **100% delivery** of all scoped items by **August 15, 2025**.

## 🧭 Continuous Evaluation Plan

| Checkpoint | Review Focus                                   | Date           |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Midpoint   | Controller-Puppet Interaction                  | July 18, 2025  |
| Final      | System Integration + Content Completion        | August 15, 2025|

---

### 🔄 Adjustment Protocol

- Weekly reviews via Obsidian dashboard.
- Adjust milestone dates based on task delays.
- Update `03.Scope of Work.md` with all scoped changes and justifications.
