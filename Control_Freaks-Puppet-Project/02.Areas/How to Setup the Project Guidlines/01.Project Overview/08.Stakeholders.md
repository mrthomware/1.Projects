# ⚠️ Risk Management – Control Freaks Vault

This Risk Management Plan addresses challenges across the **four main project areas** — **Controller Development**, **Puppet Development**, **YouTube Channel Development**, and **Documentation & Integration** — considering the constraints of a **solo creator** working in a DIY setting.

---

## 🚨 Potential Risks

### 🎛 Controller Development

#### **Risk C1: Servo Hardware Failure or Limited Precision**
- **Description**: Low-cost servos (e.g., SG90, MG996R) may jitter, stall, or wear out quickly under extended loads.
- **Impact**: May cause motion inaccuracies, script desynchronization, or damage to the puppet frame.

#### **Risk C2: Audio-Motion Synchronization Failures**
- **Description**: Firmware may fail to maintain sub-50ms sync between sound and motion.
- **Impact**: Lip-sync and emotional gestures may look unnatural, hurting believability.

#### **Risk C3: Toolchain Incompatibility**
- **Description**: Conflicts between libraries, firmware, or Obsidian scripting plugins.
- **Impact**: Lost development time from debugging and inconsistent results across environments.

---

### 🤖 Puppet Development

#### **Risk P1: Mechanical Misalignment or Plastic Fatigue**
- **Description**: 3D-printed components may flex, wear, or misalign during repeated motions.
- **Impact**: Results in mechanical inconsistency or risk of servo burnout.

#### **Risk P2: Material/Part Availability**
- **Description**: Delays in acquiring foam, hinges, or filament may block assembly.
- **Impact**: Pushes back testing and calibration stages, affecting timeline.

#### **Risk P3: Overengineering**
- **Description**: Attempting to add too many animation features before first successful prototype.
- **Impact**: Burnout and scope creep without performance gains.

---

### 🎬 YouTube Channel Development

#### **Risk Y1: Production Burnout**
- **Description**: The creator may face fatigue from managing all aspects of content creation.
- **Impact**: Declining video quality or missed publishing targets.

#### **Risk Y2: File Corruption or Data Loss**
- **Description**: Footage, scripts, or project data may be accidentally lost or overwritten.
- **Impact**: Significant rework time or loss of key milestones.

#### **Risk Y3: Low Viewer Engagement**
- **Description**: Initial videos may not attract a broad audience or receive feedback.
- **Impact**: Makes it hard to measure success or justify future expansion.

---

### 🧩 Documentation & Integration

#### **Risk D1: Vault Fragmentation or Sync Errors**
- **Description**: Obsidian notes may become disorganized or unlinked due to missed metadata or plugin failure.
- **Impact**: Hampers task tracking, script reuse, and project scalability.

#### **Risk D2: Incomplete or Inaccurate Technical Docs**
- **Description**: Final documentation may lag behind development changes.
- **Impact**: Reduces reproducibility or makes future upgrades difficult.

## 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

| Risk ID | Strategy                                                                                     | Owner         | Timeline                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| C1      | Use reliable servos; test with torque limits; keep backup units on hand.                     | Thomas Ware   | June 15–July 01, 2025           |
| C2      | Use timestamp logging; build in delay buffer; tune audio/servo sync using tools.             | Thomas Ware   | July 01–July 10, 2025           |
| C3      | Pin library versions; freeze plugin updates; document OS/hardware assumptions.               | Thomas Ware   | June 12–June 25, 2025           |
| P1      | Simulate hinges and joints in CAD; print miniatures to test tolerances.                      | Thomas Ware   | July 03–July 10, 2025           |
| P2      | Order all key parts by milestone M1-CT; substitute materials from surplus as needed.         | Thomas Ware   | Ongoing                         |
| P3      | Limit V1 puppet to jaw and eye motion only; modularize future expansions.                    | Thomas Ware   | July 10 scope checkpoint        |
| Y1      | Build-in 48-hour buffer for editing fatigue; apply Pomodoro technique to content creation.   | Thomas Ware   | July 25–Aug 01, 2025            |
| Y2      | Enable autosave; backup files to Git and external drive nightly.                             | Thomas Ware   | July 20–Aug 05, 2025            |
| Y3      | Promote video to niche audiences (LinkedIn, Discord); track views/comments weekly.           | Thomas Ware   | Aug 05–Aug 15, 2025             |
| D1      | Use Obsidian `Dataview` to track incomplete metadata; verify weekly backups.                 | Thomas Ware   | Weekly (June 20–Aug 10)         |
| D2      | Write docs concurrently with coding sessions; maintain template checklists.                  | Thomas Ware   | Aug 01–Aug 15, 2025             |
