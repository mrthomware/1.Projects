# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview â€“ Note

This document provides a **top-level overview** of the *Control Freaks Vault*, a solo-led effort to build a full-stack animatronic puppet system, combining **controller design**, **mechanical puppetry**, and **creative production workflows** for a YouTube audience.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Full Project Title**: *Control Freaks Vault: Animatronic Puppet System & Production Channel*
- **Scope**: Embedded system development, puppet fabrication, and media publishing
- **Managed By**: Thomas Ware (solo creator, builder, and producer)

---

## 1. Background and Purpose

- **Context**:  
  The Control Freaks initiative grew from previous hand-controlled puppetry experiments and storytelling via the *BlackBook Tales* channel. This new iteration focuses on automating character movement to enable **repeatable, high-fidelity puppet performance**.

- **Purpose**:  
  Transition from manual puppeteering to programmable control systems and modular animatronic builds. The goal is to create a **scalable solo workflow** that balances engineering, artistic fabrication, and YouTube storytelling.

---

## 2. Project Objectives and Goals

- **Controller Development**:
  - Build a low-latency servo controller with motion/audio sync
  - Support modular plug-in profiles for different puppet behaviors

- **Puppet Development**:
  - Fabricate a functional puppet with jaw, eye, and gesture mechanisms
  - Ensure mechanical reliability and expressive motion output

- **YouTube Channel Development**:
  - Write, film, and edit a complete puppet scene
  - Highlight engineering and storytelling in an accessible, entertaining format

---

## 3. Scope of Work

- **Inclusions**:
  - Circuit design, servo logic scripting, and Obsidian integration
  - Fabrication of one test puppet with actuated facial parts
  - Creative production pipeline: scripting, filming, publishing
  - Embedded task tracking and content flow in Obsidian Vault

- **Exclusions**:
  - No large-scale manufacturing or mass distribution
  - No team-based task sharing (solo execution only)
  - No advanced AI integration or third-party cloud automation

---

## 4. Key Deliverables

- âœ… Controller prototype with <50ms sync latency
- âœ… Fabricated puppet with working jaw/eye mechanisms
- âœ… Programmable motion scripts and YAML-embedded task logs
- âœ… 3â€“5 minute pilot video uploaded to YouTube
- âœ… Full Obsidian vault archive including diagrams, test logs, and version history

---

## 5. Timeline and Milestones

- **Start Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Controller Phase End**: July 2, 2025
- **Puppet Phase End**: July 24, 2025
- **YouTube Episode Release**: August 2, 2025
- **Documentation & Wrap-Up**: August 15, 2025

> See `05.Timeline and Milestones.md` for detailed phase planning with buffers.

## 6. Budget Overview

- **Total Project Budget**: $2,000 CAD
- **Estimated Allocation**:
  - $500 â€“ Servo motors, MCU boards, cabling
  - $350 â€“ 3D printing, foam, hardware parts
  - $300 â€“ Audio gear and filming equipment
  - $250 â€“ Software tools and simulation licenses
  - $200 â€“ Contingency
  - $400 â€“ Optional freelance editing/illustration

## 7. Stakeholders

| Stakeholder     | Role                          | Involvement                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Thomas Ware      | Creator & Engineer             | All project areas              |
| YouTube Viewers  | Indirect Stakeholders          | Provide feedback post-launch   |
| Future Collaborators | Technical/Artistic Extensions | Possible later episodes        |

---

## 8. Risk Management

- **Top Risks**:
  - Overload on solo capacity â†’ burn-out or delays
  - Servo jitter or timing mismatches
  - Workflow gaps between engineering and content production

- **Mitigation**:
  - Weekly progress reviews in `01.Timeline.md`
  - Backup controllers and modular scripting
  - Buffer days between phases; no overlapping workloads

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- One puppet performs a scripted routine synced to sound
- Control logs and documentation managed in Obsidian
- Pilot video garners engagement (views/comments)
- All three project phases completed by August 15, 2025

---

## 10. Project Governance

- **Model**: Solo-governed, milestone-reviewed
- **Tools Used**: Obsidian for docs/tasks, Git for versioning
- **Accountability**: Internal tracking with weekly status syncs

---

## 11. Communication Plan

- **Internal**:  
  - Obsidian Notes: Task logs, YAML progress, Kanban board  
  - Weekly Note Summary + Daily Task Tracking  

- **External**:  
  - Pilot video on YouTube (August 2, 2025)  
  - Progress shared monthly on LinkedIn  
  - Community polls or feedback forms after video release

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

The *Control Freaks Vault* is not just an engineering challengeâ€”itâ€™s a creative systems design experiment built by one person to prove that DIY automation, storytelling, and audience engagement can coexist in a streamlined solo pipeline. This project represents a **realistic, iterative model** for solo creators exploring animatronics and digital content.
