# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview â€“ Note

This document provides a **top-level overview** of the *Control Freaks Vault*, a solo-led initiative to develop a complete animatronic puppet systemâ€”from embedded controller to puppet mechanics to final video productionâ€”for release on YouTube and educational platforms. The Vault also functions as an Obsidian-powered project knowledge base.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Full Project Title**: *Control Freaks Vault: Animatronic Puppet System & Production Channel*
- **Scope**: Embedded controller development, puppet fabrication, scripting, filming, and publishing
- **Managed By**: Thomas Ware (solo creator, builder, and producer)

---

## 1. Background and Purpose

- **Context**:  
  Originating from experimental storytelling in the *BlackBook Tales* series, the Control Freaks project aims to transition from manual puppeteering to digital control systems, delivering high-precision, repeatable animation for solo performance.

- **Purpose**:  
  Build a solo workflow pipeline that integrates engineering, digital fabrication, and media production using open-source tools, templated documentation, and DIY automation.

---

## 2. Project Objectives and Goals

- **Controller Development**:
  - Design a low-latency, scriptable controller for servo-driven puppet gestures
  - Develop modular firmware that supports character profiles and reusable gestures

- **Puppet Development**:
  - Fabricate a fully actuated puppet head with jaw, eye, and neck movement
  - Test repeatability and physical integrity over extended use cycles

- **YouTube Channel Development**:
  - Produce and release a demo video showing the puppet in action
  - Share educational and behind-the-scenes content with creators and engineers

- **Workflow Integration**:
  - Embed all tracking, scripting, logging, and planning inside the Obsidian Vault

---

## 3. Scope of Work

- **Inclusions**:
  - PCB design, firmware writing, and motion programming
  - CAD modeling, 3D printing, assembly of puppet mechanism
  - Motion/audio sequencing and filming a scripted puppet scene
  - Knowledge capture using Templater, Dataview, and Kanban in Obsidian

- **Exclusions**:
  - No outsourced manufacturing or large-scale production
  - No concurrent team collaboration (solo execution only)
  - No reliance on AI models for real-time animation or speech generation

---

## 4. Key Deliverables

- âœ… Custom servo controller with <50ms sync latency
- âœ… Modular motion firmware with â‰¥3 character profiles
- âœ… Fully fabricated puppet with validated motion axes
- âœ… 3â€“5 minute pilot video released to YouTube
- âœ… Behind-the-scenes educational clip
- âœ… Full Obsidian vault archive with script logs, build notes, and diagrams

---

## 5. Timeline and Milestones

- **Start Date**: June 10, 2025
- **Controller Development**: June 10 â€“ June 30
- **Puppet Fabrication**: July 1 â€“ July 21
- **Motion Scripting + Demo Recording**: July 22 â€“ August 4

## 6. Budget Overview

- **Total Budget**: $2,000 CAD (self-funded)
- **Allocation**:
  - $500 â€“ Electronics (servos, controller, cabling)
  - $350 â€“ 3D printing materials, puppet body hardware
  - $300 â€“ Audio/video capture equipment
  - $250 â€“ Software licenses and CAD tools
  - $200 â€“ Contingency buffer

| Stakeholder           | Role                          | Involvement                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Thomas Ware            | Creator/Engineer               | All domains                |
| YouTube Viewers        | Audience/Feedback providers    | Post-release engagement    |
| Future Collaborators   | Mentors or co-creators         | Possible in future phases  |

---

## 8. Risk Management

- **Risks**:
  - Solo workload bottlenecks
  - Mechanical inconsistencies in motion
  - Overlap between technical builds and production editing

- **Mitigation**:
  - No concurrent tasking between phases
  - Weekly task board and timeline reviews
  - Testing and calibration between each build stage
  - Dedicated documentation days to prevent backlog

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- âœ… Puppet performs synchronized motion routine across 3 test runs
- âœ… Obsidian logs cover controller, build, and scripting phases
- âœ… Pilot video garners â‰¥5 audience comments or engagements
- âœ… Educational clip uploaded alongside pilot
- âœ… 100% completion of deliverables by August 15, 2025
