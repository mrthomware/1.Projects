# 🗓️ Timeline and Milestones – Control Freaks Vault

This timeline reflects a **sequential, solo-developer project plan** across four integrated phases:

1. **Controller Development**
2. **Puppet Development**
3. **Show Pipeline Development**
4. **Vault Integration & Documentation**

Each milestone respects realistic design, prototyping, debugging, and production pacing with no concurrent work.
