# ❓ Questions or Decision Needs

Identifying unresolved questions and pending decisions is key to maintaining progress and ensuring no critical blockers stall development in the *Control Freaks Puppet Project*.

### 🔍 Key Issues Requiring Input or Decisions

- **Decision 1 – Final Firmware Platform Selection**:
  - **Description**: Determine whether to develop firmware in C++ using PlatformIO or transition to MicroPython for faster iteration.
  - **Impact**: Impacts entire firmware architecture, long-term maintainability, and potential integration with future GUI tools.
  - **Options/Considerations**:
    - PlatformIO (C++): High control, low-level access, more robust
    - MicroPython: Faster prototyping, easier to debug, fewer external dependencies

- **Question 2 – Character Selection for First Puppet**:
  - **Description**: Decide which puppet character to prioritize in the build pipeline (Glowling, Grump, or Sidekick).
  - **Impact**: Determines 3D printing workflow, controller allocation, and voice syncing needs.
  - **Options/Considerations**:
    - Glowling: Iconic, already storyboarded
    - Grump: Mechanically simpler, good for first build
    - Sidekick: Requires dual-axial jaw

- **Decision 3 – Obsidian Note Vault Git Sync**:
  - **Description**: Should the Control Freaks Vault be connected to GitHub for versioned project documentation and rollback support?
  - **Impact**: Affects backup strategy, collaboration readiness, and risk mitigation.
  - **Options/Considerations**:
    - Use GitHub Private Repo
    - Use local Git only
    - No version control (manual backup only)
