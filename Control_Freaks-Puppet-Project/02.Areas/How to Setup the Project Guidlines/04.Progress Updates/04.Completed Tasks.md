### üóÇ Task List

- **CD-T01 ‚Äì Draft Servo Control Block Diagram**  
  - **Description**: Created a functional block diagram outlining all inputs, logic processing, and servo outputs for the puppet controller.  
  - **Completion Date**: 2025-06-10  
  - **Significance**: Established the foundation for the controller design, unifying mechanical and electrical interface assumptions.

- **CD-T02 ‚Äì Design Schematic in CAD Software**  
  - **Description**: Completed a detailed KiCad schematic covering the microcontroller, connectors, power distribution, and interface logic.  
  - **Completion Date**: 2025-06-13  
  - **Significance**: Enables netlist verification and PCB layout planning; a prerequisite for ERC in CD-T03.

- **OV-T01 ‚Äì Backup Full Working Directory**  
  - **Description**: Archived the entire project directory including system files, assets, and notes into `/Archive/2025-Backup-06-14.zip`.  
  - **Completion Date**: 2025-06-14  
  - **Significance**: Ensures baseline restore point before PCB fabrication and Obsidian restructuring.

### üåü Achievements and Outcomes

- Enabled the start of **ERC validation** and **PCB layout tasks**.
- De-risked design loss by snapshotting the current Vault state.
- Unlocked firmware logic planning (CD-T10) by establishing firm I/O references from the schematic.

---

### üß± Challenges Overcome

- **KiCad Library Conflicts**: Resolved mismatches in footprint paths by updating symbol tables.
- **Version Control Overhead**: Improved snapshot frequency and folder naming for clarity and safety.

---

### ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps Post-Completion

- Proceed with **CD-T03** ‚Äì Perform ERC and Net Validation  
- Initiate firmware draft logic (flowchart phase) for **CD-T10**  
- Store and document schematic diagrams for **Vault Reference (OV-T04)**
