# 🛠️ Mitigation Actions

Addressing known issues through defined mitigation steps ensures continued momentum and reduces potential delays or failures in the Control Freaks Puppet Project.

---

### 🔧 Actions for Current Issues

- **Action for Issue 1 – PCB Debugging Risks**:
  - **Description**: Conduct isolated subsystem testing of analog components prior to full board assembly. Validate power integrity and servo trace separation through staged prototyping.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Early detection and containment of EMI-related problems before affecting full controller functionality.
  - **Implementation Timeline**: Start CD-T06 by June 20, with test results reviewed before CD-T07 layout finalization on July 1.

- **Action for Issue 2 – Developer Overload Risk**:
  - **Description**: Insert dedicated review and rest checkpoints between phases. Extend individual task durations to include buffer and reduce deadline stress.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Improved sustainability and higher quality outputs with less risk of burnout or task abandonment.
  - **Implementation Timeline**: Review implementation on June 25 post CD-T05 milestone, and apply phase buffers in Master Timeline by July 1.

- **Action for Issue 3 – Puppet Shell Print Failures**:
  - **Description**: Create test fitting shells and jaw geometries using low-infill PLA on the Ender 3, verifying hinge clearances and joint integrity before final prints.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Reduced material waste and fewer failed prints during PD-T03.
  - **Implementation Timeline**: Start fitting tests by July 20. Full prints to begin August 1 during PD-T04.

### 📦 Resource Allocation

- **PCB Testing Setup**: Multimeter, oscilloscope, servo testing jig, low-voltage power supply. All available.
- **Time Buffer Allocation**: Re-distributed via the updated Gantt (see `[[Buffer_Time.md]]`).
- **3D Print Supplies**: Backup spools pre-ordered. Cooling and adhesion enhancements confirmed.

---

### 📊 Monitoring and Adjustment

- **Monitoring Plan**: Task completion logs updated daily with `#issue-tag` tracking in Obsidian Tasks plugin.
- **Adjustment Strategy**: If mitigation step timelines slip by >3 days, escalate issue to Priority Review status in Progress Dashboard.

---

### 📈 Impact Assessment

- **On Timeline**: Expected reduction in controller delays by at least 1 week.
- **On Budget**: Estimated cost increase <5% due to test materials; acceptable within Phase 1 budget scope.
- **Risk of Action**: Risk of over-testing minor changes mitigated by setting a cap on test iterations.

---

### 📣 Communication Plan

- **Internal Communication**: Tasks tagged with `#mitigation` will be reviewed at each Weekly Check-In note.
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Progress on mitigation strategies will be summarized in each Progress Report and Milestone Review.
