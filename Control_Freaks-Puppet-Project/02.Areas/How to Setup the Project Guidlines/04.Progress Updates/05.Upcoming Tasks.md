# üïí Upcoming Tasks

> This section lists scheduled tasks for the upcoming project cycle to help align execution, resource planning, and milestone expectations.

### üóìÔ∏è Task Schedule

- **CD-T03 ‚Äì Perform ERC and Net Validation**  
  - **Description**: Run electrical rule check in KiCad and verify connections across all net classes before proceeding to board layout.  
  - **Scheduled Start Date**: 2025-06-16  
  - **Expected Duration**: 2 days  
  - **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **PD-T01 ‚Äì Draft Puppet Shell Concepts**  
  - **Description**: Begin sketching shell geometry based on servo layout and aesthetic guidelines for facial and mechanical access.  
  - **Scheduled Start Date**: 2025-06-17  
  - **Expected Duration**: 3 days  
  - **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **OV-T02 ‚Äì Structure PARA Folders and Insert Blocks**  
  - **Description**: Create PARA-compliant folder hierarchy and embed current tasks and references into the Control Freaks Vault.  
  - **Scheduled Start Date**: 2025-06-18  
  - **Expected Duration**: 2 days  
  - **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **SP-T01 ‚Äì Draft Pilot Script**  
  - **Description**: Begin scriptwriting for Episode 1 to align voiceover with puppet gestures and action flow.  
  - **Scheduled Start Date**: 2025-06-19  
  - **Expected Duration**: 4 days  
  - **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

### üß∞ Preparations and Prerequisites

- **CD-T03**: Schematic and component library must be finalized (complete from CD-T02).
- **PD-T01**: Access to puppet servo layout and clearance diagrams.
- **OV-T02**: Vault backup (OV-T01) must be confirmed completed.
- **SP-T01**: Scene structure and tone reference board must be available.

---

### üîß Resources and Support

- **Human Resources**: Solo development (Thomas Ware); hours allocated per task are manageable.  
- **Equipment**: KiCad and tablet sketch software operational; printer idle.  
- **Budget**: No additional spending anticipated for this cycle.  
- **Support Needed**: Review from peers for script tone once SP-T01 is drafted.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment and Mitigation

- **PD-T01 Risk**: Concept sketches might delay 3D modeling if iteration loop expands.  
  - *Mitigation*: Set time-boxed review checkpoints to avoid overdesign.
  
- **SP-T01 Risk**: Writer‚Äôs block or indecision on format length.  
  - *Mitigation*: Use pre-built character themes and dialog prompts to kickstart scripting.

---

### üéØ Integration with Project Goals

- **CD-T03** ensures design is ready for PCB fabrication.  
- **PD-T01** begins physical design phase, critical for puppet test rig.  
- **OV-T02** improves task visibility and reduces organizational friction.  
- **SP-T01** marks the start of content production pipeline, driving downstream animation tasks.
