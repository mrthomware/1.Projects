# 🚧 Current Issues and Challenges

A focused breakdown of present issues affecting progress in the Control Freaks Puppet Project, along with their impacts and management strategies.

---

### 🛑 Issue Overview

- **Issue 1 – PCB ERC & DRC Failures**
  - **Description**: The schematic for the servo controller board (CD-T03) has failed multiple ERC and DRC checks due to undefined power nets and incorrectly assigned footprints.
  - **Impact**: This blocks layout progress and delays the transition to CD-T04 (Board layout & routing).
  - **Current Status**: Actively under review. Pin assignments are being rechecked, and net labels are being restructured.

- **Issue 2 – Character Shell Redesign Delays**
  - **Description**: The puppet exterior design has not progressed as expected due to conflicting priorities and incomplete design references for the internal servo structure.
  - **Impact**: Causes bottlenecks in both Puppet CAD prototyping (PD-T02) and foam pattern testing.
  - **Current Status**: Still pending. Blocked by CD-T06 (Component Placement Test) outputs.

- **Issue 3 – Vault Syncing Errors**
  - **Description**: During task data organization, several Obsidian Vault pages were incorrectly linked or duplicated between “New CFV Tasks” and old CF tasks.
  - **Impact**: Causes confusion in the Master Task List and status reporting.
  - **Current Status**: Manual fix in progress. All legacy CF pages are being tagged `#deprecated`.

### 🛠️ Mitigation and Resolution Plans

- **For Issue 1**:
  - **Strategy**: Perform incremental rule checks per schematic zone and simplify net naming conventions.
  - **Responsible**: Thomas Ware
  - **ETA**: June 17, 2025

- **For Issue 2**:
  - **Strategy**: Refocus on completing component placement test (CD-T06) to unblock accurate puppet framing.
  - **Responsible**: Thomas Ware
  - **ETA**: June 22, 2025

- **For Issue 3**:
  - **Strategy**: Full audit of the task note registry with YAML ID cross-check.
  - **Responsible**: Thomas Ware
  - **ETA**: June 18, 2025

### 📉 Impact on Project Timeline and Objectives

- **Overall Project Impact**: These issues risk delaying the controller fabrication sequence and puppet prototyping sync.
- **Adjustments to Plan**:
  - Shift CD-T04 to begin no earlier than June 18
  - Move PD-T02 start date to June 24
  - Insert task `OV-T03` to audit Vault metadata

---

### 📡 Communication and Stakeholder Management

- **Stakeholder Communication**: Issues have been logged in the weekly sync note and linked to the Kanban index.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Vault editors and collaborators can flag any inconsistencies using the tag `#vault-issue` for automatic inbox flagging.
