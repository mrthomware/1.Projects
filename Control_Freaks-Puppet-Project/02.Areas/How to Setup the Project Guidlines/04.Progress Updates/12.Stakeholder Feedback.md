# 💬 Stakeholder Feedback

Capturing and responding to stakeholder feedback ensures the project remains aligned with expectations, builds trust, and improves design decisions throughout the puppet development lifecycle.

---

### 🧾 Summary of Feedback

- **Feedback 1 – Complexity of Control Setup**  
  - **Summary**: Concerns were raised about the steep learning curve of the current controller design. Some stakeholders suggested simplifying the interface or providing more visual cues for beginners.  
  - **Source**: Internal team review session with maker community mentors.

- **Feedback 2 – Puppet Appeal to Younger Audiences**  
  - **Summary**: The initial character design concepts were viewed as potentially too dark or mature for younger audiences. A suggestion was made to develop a softer, more expressive version of "Grump" for dual-age appeal.  
  - **Source**: Early feedback from content reviewers familiar with YouTube Kids policies.

- **Feedback 3 – Documentation Clarity in Obsidian Vault**  
  - **Summary**: Some collaborators found the structure of the vault difficult to navigate, especially in identifying project phases and current task statuses.  
  - **Source**: Peer reviewers during onboarding walkthrough.
