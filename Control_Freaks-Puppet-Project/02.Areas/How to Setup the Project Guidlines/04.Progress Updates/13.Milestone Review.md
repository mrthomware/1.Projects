## 🏁 Milestone Review

Regular milestone reviews help gauge progress, adjust timelines, and maintain alignment with strategic project goals. This document provides a status update for each declared milestone in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**.

---

### ✅ Milestone Statuses

- **Milestone 1 – Complete schematic capture and PCB layout for the servo controller board**
  - **Status**: In Progress
  - **Details**: Preliminary schematic complete. Awaiting component selection verification and layout initiation. Estimated to complete by July 10, 2025.

- **Milestone 2 – Assemble first physical prototype and begin hardware debugging**
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Details**: Blocked by Milestone 1. Components not yet ordered. Physical prototyping expected to begin mid-July 2025 after layout approval.

- **Milestone 3 – Complete firmware development and test audio-synced servo movements**
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Details**: Firmware development structure designed, but real hardware test beds are not yet available. Will proceed once hardware is validated.

- **Milestone 4 – Demo full working sync system on test rig**
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Details**: Scheduled for September after hardware and firmware stability is confirmed. Sync test rig planning is underway.

### 🔍 Analysis and Impact

- **Impact of Milestone Completion**:
  - Completion of Milestone 1 will unlock PCB manufacturing and enable physical assembly.
  - Firmware development will be significantly streamlined once hardware inputs are finalized.

- **Consequences of Delays**:
  - Delays in Milestone 1 directly shift the entire project timeline forward by ~2–3 weeks.
  - Mitigation includes parallel work on controller documentation and firmware logic structure to reduce downtime.

---

### 🛠️ Actions and Adjustments

- **Corrective Actions**:
  - Prioritized sourcing of components and created a fast-track vendor list.
  - Set weekly layout check-ins until board files are finalized.

- **Rescheduling**:
  - No major milestone dates shifted yet, but buffer time from the timeline may be partially consumed.

---

### 📣 Stakeholder Communication

- A formal update is planned via `[[Progress Update – 2025-06-20.md]]`
- Stakeholders will receive visual Gantt snapshots and updated PCB layouts by email.

---

### 🔭 Forward Planning

- **Next Milestones**:
  - Milestone 1 must be closed on schedule to maintain downstream integrity.
  - Early parts of Puppet Design (PD-T01 and PD-T02) can begin concurrently during PCB fabrication.

- **Preparation for Upcoming Milestones**:
  - All datasheets, vendor specs, and initial BOM will be added to Obsidian Vault for version tracking.
  - A simulation of the firmware environment is being explored to expedite audio-to-motion sync.
