## Lessons Learned ‚Äì Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Technical and Design Insights
- **Iterative Design is Essential**  
  Early schematic drafts and rough physical models helped catch dimensional and component-fit issues before committing to final builds. Iterating quickly in CAD and firmware reduced downstream issues.
  
- **Prototype Sooner**  
  Building a basic proof-of-concept (even with junk parts) provided early feedback and helped avoid overdesigning unnecessary complexity.

- **Analog Input Noise Needs Dedicated Handling**  
  Elevator and servo systems based on analog feedback required careful filtering (hardware and code). Buffer tolerances of ¬±200 became standard after empirical testing.

---

### Process Best Practices
- **Strict Task Sequencing for Solo Development**  
  Enforcing single-task progression (no parallel work) helped maintain clarity, focus, and prevent mental overload. All Gantt timelines now reflect this enforced linearity.

- **Use of YAML Metadata and Dataview**  
  Embedding detailed YAML frontmatter in Obsidian notes allowed automatic project indexing, milestone tracking, and log filtering. This dramatically improved traceability and project clarity.

- **Code Modularity in Firmware**  
  Refactoring firmware into reusable function blocks saved hours in later servo-tuning scripts. Maintaining separate test routines for each hardware component proved critical in debugging.

---

### Communication and Review
- **Document Everything**  
  Weekly reflections and note templates proved valuable in retaining decision rationale and prevented knowledge loss. Linking notes to visual diagrams and commits ensured complete traceability.

- **Feedback Loops Improve Design**  
  Even informal feedback from online peers revealed overlooked details, especially in puppet head articulation. Peer review‚Äîeven if brief‚Äîconsistently improved outcomes.

### Personal and Team Growth
- **Growth Through Frustration**  
  Technical roadblocks in PCB design and servo tuning led to deeper understanding of electrical noise, component tolerances, and real-world control timing.

- **Learning Through Teaching**  
  Recording videos and writing documentation for Control Freaks improved the ability to communicate complex design decisions and helped spot assumptions that needed validation.

---

### Knowledge Transfer
- **Templates Drive Consistency**  
  Creating and using markdown templates (for Tasks, Milestones, Risks, Notes) ensured every log entry contained the necessary details, minimizing ambiguity later.

- **Visual Planning Tools Boost Motivation**  
  Using Mermaid Gantt charts and Kanban boards in Obsidian visually tracked progress and maintained engagement, especially during longer debugging phases.
