# Reflections

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Analog signal interference disrupted servo feedback loop timing.
  - Firmware development took longer due to hardware-level PWM/ADC conflicts.
  - Lack of formal workspace led to organization inefficiencies during prototyping.
  
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Rewired the circuit with improved grounding and shielding.
  - Isolated firmware modules for testing to reduce debug cycles.
  - Created labeled hardware bins and modular test jigs for faster setup.

---

### Team Performance

- **Team Dynamics**:
  - As a solo developer, focused work sessions and rigid task scheduling were necessary.
  - Maintained an Obsidian-based Kanban and task register to simulate collaborative tracking.

- **Areas of Strength and Improvement**:
  - Strengths: Excellent technical execution, solo task accountability, integrated storytelling pipeline.
  - Improvements: Build a system for structured self-feedback and regular check-in reviews to mimic team retrospectives.

---

### Project Milestones

- **Milestone Review**:
  - Key milestones achieved: controller PCB built, firmware tested, puppet rig assembled and synced.
  
- **Successes and Improvements**:
  - Successes: Schematic capture completed early, PCB works with minimal rework.
  - Improvements: Need better overlap between storytelling and electronics phases to streamline transitions.

---

### Personal Development

- **Growth and Learning**:
  - Gained deeper understanding of analog signal conditioning and PID loop timing.
  - Developed storytelling cadence for Control Freaks YouTube format.

- **Skills and Knowledge Development**:
  - Learned EasyEDA routing strategies, low-noise servo control, and YAML-based automation in Obsidian.

---

### Stakeholder Satisfaction

- **Feedback Review**:
  - Makerspace mentors praised the creative-engineering integration.
  - External feedback appreciated the real-world application of student-learned skills.

- **Management of Expectations**:
  - Kept internal and external stakeholders informed through weekly summaries and Obsidian-linked updates.

---

### Efficiency and Effectiveness

- **Analysis of Project Processes**:
  - Early process friction was caused by unclear firmware goals‚Äîfixed by separating mechanical vs software milestones.
  - Rapid progress made after standardizing workspace layout and digital note structuring.

---

### Adaptation to Change

- **Responses to Changes/Events**:
  - Added 3-week buffer mid-way after hardware debugging exceeded planned time.
  - Updated project Gantt and vault documentation live in response to design revisions.

---

### Post-Project Review

- **Overall Success and Challenges**:
  - A strong solo prototype that met its learning goals and produced tangible outputs: puppet + firmware + vault.
  - Main challenge was balancing school, work, and solo development across phases.

- **Future Learnings**:
  - Treat documentation as a real deliverable, not just a byproduct.
  - Use templates from day one to prevent inconsistent record-keeping.

---

### Actionable Improvements

- **Improvements for Future Projects**:
  - Begin PCB and CAD prototyping in parallel to reduce cross-phase delays.
  - Automate test logging and integrate direct feedback tracking into Obsidian.
  - Add time-tracking tags to better reflect true effort distribution.

---

### Knowledge Sharing

- **Sharing with Team and Stakeholders**:
  - All stages captured in Obsidian vault under PARA-aligned structure.
  - Planning a demo at the makerspace to share findings and approaches.
  - GitHub repo includes firmware, CAD files, and YAML docs with README for onboarding others.
