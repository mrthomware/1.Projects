# Project Notes and Reflections for Control Freaks Puppet Project

## Notes

### Meeting Summaries

- **Date and Attendees**:
  - 2025-06-01 ‚Äì Thomas Ware
- **Key Points and Decisions**:
  - Review of Gantt timeline and milestones.
  - Solo execution requires strict sequential scheduling.
  - Extended timeline for controller development.
- **Action Items and Responsibilities**:
  - Draft detailed breakdown of controller tasks.
  - Allocate more time to firmware and prototyping.

### Task Updates

- **Task Name**:
  - CD-T01: Define System Requirements
- **Progress and Changes**:
  - Initial sketch and control flow defined.
  - No physical prototyping started yet.
- **Updated Deadlines and Resources**:
  - Deadline extended to July 10, 2025, to reflect realistic workload.

### Stakeholder Communications

- **Date and Stakeholder**:
  - 2025-06-07 ‚Äì YouTube audience expectations review
- **Summary of Interaction**:
  - Stakeholders expect entertaining and technically accurate puppet shows.
- **Feedback and Suggestions**:
  - Ensure transparency in build process and progress logs.

### Risk Logs

- **New Risks or Changes**:
  - Risk of burnout due to solo workload.
  - Hardware delays may affect build schedule.
- **Risk Mitigation Effectiveness**:
  - Implemented buffer time after each major task.
  - Breaking tasks into micro-tasks for mental load management.

### Change Records

- **Change Details**:
  - Updated Gantt chart to reflect strictly sequential workflow.
- **Reason and Impact**:
  - Solo developer constraint requires serial execution to avoid overlap.

### Budget Tracking

- **Current Expenditures**:
  - Software: Astro, Gradio, AI tools ‚Äì ~$200/mo
  - Hardware (pending): Estimated $400 for PCB and components
- **Discrepancies and Adjustments**:
  - No budget discrepancies as of yet. Awaiting parts purchasing phase.

### Resource Usage

- **Resource Details**:
  - Tools: ChatGPT (for management, design, and scripting), Fritzing, Astro, TIA Portal
- **Utilization Notes**:
  - Heavy use of AI for initial design and documentation.
  - No physical hardware resources consumed yet.

### Technical Notes (for technical projects)

- **Technical Details**:
  - PLC integration under research; servo controller planned with custom firmware.
  - Animatronic character control based on timing and audio sync.
- **Documentation for Reference**:
  - Gantt Chart.md
  - Controller task index: CD-T01 to CD-T14

### Lessons Learned

- **Insights and Best Practices**:
  - Overplanning leads to better long-term sustainability.
  - Strict task isolation is vital when operating solo.

## Reflections

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Scope creep from ambitious initial planning.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Refined Gantt and documentation process to match actual solo dev constraints.

### Team Performance

- **Team Dynamics**:
  - Solo project; performance based on self-motivation and routine.
- **Areas of Strength and Improvement**:
  - Strength: documentation discipline
  - Improvement: prototyping pace and hands-on execution

### Project Milestones

- **Milestone Review**:
  - Milestone 1 (schematic + PCB) underway but extended.
- **Successes and Improvements**:
  - Documentation infrastructure is solid; project clarity high.

### Personal Development

- **Growth and Learning**:
  - Improved task tracking, time estimation, and version control.
- **Skills and Knowledge Development**:
  - Enhanced understanding of sequential tasking and resource pacing.

### Stakeholder Satisfaction

- **Feedback Review**:
  - Early previews and progress reports well-received.
- **Management of Expectations**:
  - Clear communication that development is non-linear and solo-driven.

### Efficiency and Effectiveness

- **Analysis of Project Processes**:
  - Non-parallel scheduling has improved focus but slows delivery.
  - Efficient use of tools like ChatGPT for planning.

### Adaptation to Change

- **Responses to Changes/Events**:
  - Adjusted timelines and phase breakdown to reflect new understanding of workload.

### Post-Project Review

- **Overall Success and Challenges**:
  - Early to review. Initial stage shows high alignment between plan and execution.
- **Future Learnings**:
  - Always budget more time than you think for prototyping as a solo builder.

### Actionable Improvements

- **Improvements for Future Projects**:
  - Define clear end criteria for each task in advance.
  - Timebox ideation and document updates.

### Knowledge Sharing

- **Sharing with Team and Stakeholders**:
  - Regular updates via Gantt, Kanban, and progress notes.
  - Plans to publish behind-the-scenes on Control Freaks YouTube channel.
