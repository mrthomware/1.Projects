## Team Performance Evaluation for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Team Dynamics

- **Collaboration and Communication**:
  - As a solo project, collaboration occurs between internal documentation systems and the self. Communication is highly organized via daily task breakdowns and periodic milestone reflections using Obsidian.
  - File naming conventions, task identifiers, and PARA structure enable clear navigation and maintain discipline in tracking progress.

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Internal project conflicts (e.g., over-prioritizing technical over creative needs) are managed through weekly reviews and rebalancing goals.
  - Decisions are logged in the Reflection Notes to record context for future audits.

- **Morale and Engagement**:
  - Project enthusiasm remains high, especially during prototyping and testing stages. However, energy dips slightly during extended documentation or debugging periods.
  - Regular injection of creative work (e.g., puppet facial design) helps renew engagement.

---

### Areas of Strength

- **Technical Proficiency**:
  - Demonstrated strong proficiency in:
    - Schematic and PCB design (KiCad)
    - 3D modeling for puppet parts (Fusion 360)
    - Firmware writing and testing (STM32 & RP2040 targets)
    - Knowledge organization using Obsidian

- **Innovation and Problem-Solving**:
  - Developed a modular servo interface system to reduce mechanical dependency on firmware iterations.
  - Solved part supply delays by shifting focus to controller breadboarding using simulators.

- **Adherence to Deadlines and Quality Standards**:
  - Met most task deadlines as defined in `New CFV Tasks`.
  - Output consistently meets the high design, documentation, and test standards set for the Control Freaks pipeline.

---

### Areas for Improvement

- **Skill Development**:
  - Analog signal processing and PID control tuning need further refinement.
  - Consider focused learning modules on real-time control strategies and signal filtering.

- **Process Enhancements**:
  - Add weekly calendar reminders for mid-task reviews and Obsidian check-ins.
  - Automate backup of YAML task summaries to reduce friction during reporting.

- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Some over-investment in visual design early on led to bottlenecks in testing. Resources (time) will be reallocated based on priority tiers.

---

### Individual Contributions

- **Recognizing Individual Achievements**:
  - Successfully integrated YAML-driven task tracking with Gantt timelines in Obsidian.
  - Created the servo-puppet interface prototype without external assistance, achieving full motion range and test loop execution.

- **Individual Development Needs**:
  - Improve task scoping to reduce "task creep" in micro-task execution.
  - Strengthen ability to pause non-blocking aesthetic work during critical debug cycles.

---

### Feedback and Development Plans

- **Feedback Mechanisms**:
  - Weekly reviews serve as a feedback loop. Changes, reassignments, and improvement ideas are noted in Reflections.
  - `Process Snapshot` documents offer structured checkpoints every 10 days.

- **Personal Development Plans**:
  - Target learning goals:
    - Complete a focused PID controller simulation course by end of Phase 1
    - Begin weekly blog-style notes in Vault documenting design insights and technical lessons

---

### Conclusion

- **Overall Team Assessment**:
  - Solo project execution is steady, thoughtful, and improving with each iteration.
  - Strengths lie in planning, structured documentation, and design execution. Improvement needed in scheduling buffer for creative cycles.

- **Future Goals and Objectives**:
  - Complete Controller Phase with full test bench demo by August 2025.
  - Publish GitHub documentation aligned with PARA Framework.
  - Maintain morale by alternating high-focus logic work with creative puppet iteration.
