## Resource Usage for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Hardware Components

- **Resource**: Breadboard Prototyping Kit
  - **Utilization Notes**: Used for early-stage testing of MCU, driver ICs, and sensor inputs during Task CD-T05. Kit is sufficient for up to three subsystem tests; no shortages yet observed.

- **Resource**: Microcontroller Units (MCUs) ‚Äì ESP32 and ATmega328P
  - **Utilization Notes**: ESP32 preferred for WiFi/audio sync tests; ATmega reserved for fallback. Need to confirm servo signal compatibility during CD-T06.

- **Resource**: Servo Motors (Standard Analog)
  - **Utilization Notes**: 8 servos reserved for puppet jaw, eyes, and brow control. Currently idle until mechanical head mock-up is complete (PD-T03).

### Software Tools

- **Resource**: KiCad EDA Suite
  - **Utilization Notes**: Being used to draft PCB schematic and layout (CD-T03). Learning curve is moderate; templates and libraries for common ICs are actively used.

- **Resource**: Arduino IDE / PlatformIO
  - **Utilization Notes**: PlatformIO preferred due to build efficiency and ESP32 compatibility. Used for firmware prototyping (CD-T08).

- **Resource**: Fusion 360
  - **Utilization Notes**: Actively used for puppet jaw and skull bracket designs (PD-T02). File management system set up under versioned STL exports.

### Workspace & Equipment

- **Resource**: Home Workbench / Soldering Station
  - **Utilization Notes**: Fully operational. Tools available include variable temp soldering iron, multimeter, and oscilloscope. Adequate for prototyping and test phases.

- **Resource**: 3D Printer (Creality Ender 3 V2)
  - **Utilization Notes**: Not yet deployed. Will be used starting in PD-T04 to fabricate puppet skeleton components. Initial material stock (PLA, TPU) sufficient for two iterations.
