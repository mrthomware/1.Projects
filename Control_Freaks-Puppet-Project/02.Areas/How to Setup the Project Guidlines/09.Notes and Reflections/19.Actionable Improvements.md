## Actionable Improvements for Future Projects

### Reflections from Control Freaks Puppet Project
- **Summary of Learnings**:
  - The project showcased the need for extended time allocation in hardware/firmware development when working solo. Early milestone setting proved effective, but gaps in communication tracking, component availability, and team feedback loops introduced delays and rework.

---

### Identified Areas for Improvement

#### Process Enhancements
- Implement more structured weekly review checkpoints to track progress and adjust timelines.
- Automate task tracking using Obsidian Dataview and inline metadata queries.

#### Risk Management Strategies
- Develop preemptive contingency plans for each technical phase (PCB errors, servo behavior, part sourcing).
- Use a visual risk matrix during milestone planning to rate severity and likelihood of risks upfront.

#### Stakeholder Engagement
- Maintain a shared stakeholder feedback register from prototype stages.
- Schedule regular review demos (monthly) even for solo projects to allow external feedback windows.

---

### Technology and Tools

#### Adoption of New Technologies
- Adopt KiCad‚Äôs scripting API for auto-generating test point annotations.
- Introduce CAD/PCB versioning integration using Git with custom hooks for snapshot backups.

#### Upgrading Existing Systems
- Transition from static Trello boards to Notion or Obsidian+Kanban plugin for integrated planning and retrospectives.
- Refactor control firmware into modular C++ classes for reuse in future animatronic puppets.

---

### Team Development and Training

#### Skills Enhancement
- Take a short course or guided module in firmware debugging and oscilloscope usage.
- Practice servo kinematic scripting to prepare for next phase of puppet lip-sync integration.

#### Team Building
- Initiate peer review sessions with other makers online (Discord, Reddit robotics groups).
- Document and present progress weekly on YouTube DevLog for accountability and interaction.

---

### Communication and Reporting

#### Effective Communication Plans
- Use templated Obsidian entries for weekly status updates.
- Develop a biweekly summary dashboard page from Obsidian queries to share with collaborators or future self-review.

#### Reporting Formats
- Use Mermaid timelines for all milestone visualizations.
- Add linked checklists and inline Dataview tables to progress reports for faster readability.

---

### Quality Control

#### Quality Assurance Practices
- Implement a formal design review step after schematic capture, involving outside review or a checklist-based audit.
- Simulate firmware timing and servo response before uploading to prototype hardware.

---

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

#### Documentation Practices
- Use version-controlled `.md` templates for build logs, annotated board changes, and firmware version notes.
- Include photos, diagrams, and embedded Mermaid charts in each Obsidian task card.

#### Lessons Learned Repository
- Build a central `Lessons Learned` note indexed by project tag and milestone date.
- Cross-link lessons with reference images, Gantt snapshots, and Git commit hashes.
