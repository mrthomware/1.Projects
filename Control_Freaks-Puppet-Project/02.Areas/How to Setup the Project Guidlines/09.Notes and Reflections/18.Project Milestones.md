## Project Milestones Review for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Milestone Review

- **Milestone 1**: July 10, 2025
  - **Description**: Completed schematic capture and PCB layout for the servo controller board.

- **Milestone 2**: August 10, 2025 *(expected)*
  - **Description**: Assemble the first physical prototype and begin hardware debugging.

- **Milestone 3**: September 10, 2025 *(expected)*
  - **Description**: Complete firmware development and test audio-synced servo movements.

- **Milestone 4**: October 5, 2025 *(expected)*
  - **Description**: Demo full working sync system on test rig.

### Evaluation of Each Milestone

#### Milestone 1 ‚Äì PCB Design Finalized

- **Achievement Analysis**:
  - Successfully completed on time. All critical traces were routed, and the design passed DRC and ERC without error.
- **Challenges Encountered**:
  - Delays in choosing the correct power regulator caused a brief stall. Required several datasheet reviews and simulations.
- **Stakeholder Feedback**:
  - Positive early review from instructors and Discord dev peers; encouraged to submit layout for community review.

---

### Successes

- **Key Successes**:
  - Efficient completion of schematic and PCB layout without design rework.
  - Identification of EMI-sensitive zones and proactive routing separation.
- **Factors Contributing to Success**:
  - Upfront design clarity, continuous testing of subsystems in simulation.
  - Use of Git-based versioning for schematic evolution.

---

### Areas for Improvement

- **Identified Improvement Areas**:
  - PCB silkscreen layer was not adequately annotated for test points; this needs revision in the next board pass.
  - Workflow bottlenecks in sourcing parts before layout finalization.
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Begin sourcing simultaneously with schematic validation to avoid delays.
  - Annotate layers for downstream testing and documentation.

---

### Future Milestone Planning

- **Upcoming Milestones**:
  - **August 10, 2025** ‚Äì Physical prototype assembly and hardware debugging.
  - **September 10, 2025** ‚Äì Firmware test with synchronized servo movement.
  - **October 5, 2025** ‚Äì Live test rig demo for full puppet act simulation.

- **Action Plans for Improvement**:
  - Begin ordering components for Milestone 2 immediately.
  - Reserve dedicated weekly testing slots for hardware iterations.
  - Prepare firmware debug log templates in Obsidian for quick tracking.
