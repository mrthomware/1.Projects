# Challenges and Solutions

## Challenge 1: **Controller Debugging Complexity (CD-T06)**
- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Inconsistent signal response from the servo controller during bench testing.
  - Cross-talk between signal traces on the prototype PCB led to intermittent failures.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Redesigned trace layout to improve signal isolation and added decoupling capacitors near the driver ICs.
  - Reflowed solder joints and verified with oscilloscope to validate corrected behavior.

## Challenge 2: **Time Constraints and Solo Development**
- **Challenges Faced**:
  - As a solo developer, balancing detailed documentation and prototyping caused sequential task backlogs.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Implemented strict single-threaded task queue using Obsidian PARA structure and daily YAML logs to prevent overlap.
  - Applied time blocking to allocate consistent design, build, and reflection intervals.

## Challenge 3: **Budget Overruns in Materials**
- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Unexpected component failures led to multiple replacements during initial testing phase.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Pre-emptively sourced backup parts using bulk purchases where possible and reserved contingency funds specifically for early development phase risks.

## Challenge 4: **Initial Firmware Sync Failures (CD-T09)**
- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Firmware responsible for servo animation timing failed to synchronize consistently with audio signal.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Introduced timestamped UART debug logging to trace timing discrepancies.
  - Rewrote interrupt handler for cleaner edge detection and synced it to millisecond-resolution frame tick.

## Challenge 5: **Scope Drift During Puppet Sketch Revision**
- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Frequent design changes to puppet head proportions delayed PD-T01 to PD-T03 progression.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Locked design freeze milestone for base puppet geometry before modeling was approved.
  - Archived all previous iterations to prevent regression and refocusing.
