## Personal Development Plan for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Growth and Learning

- **Personal Growth Goals**:
  - Strengthen project planning and task breakdown for long-term solo creative engineering projects.
  - Improve confidence in public documentation of engineering progress via Obsidian workflows.
  - Build creative resilience through structured journaling and reflections during slow progress phases.

- **Learning Opportunities**:
  - Complete structured tutorials on embedded systems programming (STM32 and Arduino platforms).
  - Attend maker/robotics community meetups or hackathons to broaden exposure and networking.
  - Use the Control Freaks Vault to regularly reflect and refine technical and design thinking.

### Skills and Knowledge Development

- **Skill Enhancement**:
  - Deepen proficiency in KiCad for PCB layout and revision workflows.
  - Learn and apply GitHub project boards for better task visualization and history tracking.
  - Refine mechanical assembly techniques for puppet joint articulation and servo integration.

- **Knowledge Acquisition**:
  - Study timing constraints and jitter control in microcontroller PWM signal generation.
  - Research audio synchronization methods and data pipelines for real-time animation playback.
  - Acquire foundational knowledge in animatronic lip-sync algorithms and servo choreography.

- **Training and Education**:
  - Self-guided study through curated YouTube tutorials on embedded design and servo control.
  - Enroll in online courses such as ‚ÄúEmbedded Systems Essentials‚Äù or ‚ÄúIntro to Mechatronics.‚Äù
  - Schedule weekly study sprints dedicated to reviewing relevant datasheets and example code.

### Action Plan

- **Actionable Steps**:
  - Dedicate Monday evenings for electronics/firmware learning and Fridays for puppet mechanics.
  - Maintain a development reflection log inside Obsidian after each major task or failure.
  - Organize milestone-based reviews and apply lessons learned into future sprint planning.

- **Timeline for Achievement**:
  - Complete Rev B PCB and test firmware by August 2025.
  - Finish a full puppet rig with mounted servos and demo video by Q4 2025.
  - Conclude a 3-month learning cycle with a self-review journal entry by end of September 2025.

### Monitoring and Reflection

- **Self-Assessment**:
  - Conduct monthly reviews of completed tasks and quality of outcomes.
  - Evaluate clarity of technical documentation and time spent on learning vs. doing.

- **Feedback Solicitation**:
  - Share progress and get feedback from online communities (e.g., Reddit r/robotics, Hackaday).
  - Periodically ask peers for input on circuit layout clarity, code readability, and animation fluidity.

### Documenting Progress

- **Progress Records**:
  - Log completed study resources, milestones hit, and journaling notes in `Notes/Reflections/Personal_Dev.md`.
  - Save before-and-after comparison snapshots of puppet motion profiles and control boards.

### Alignment with Project Goals

- **Contribution to Project**:
  - These personal development goals directly support the successful build and operation of the Control Freaks Puppet.
  - Increased skill levels enable more ambitious animation, better debugging, and faster iteration cycles.
