## Knowledge Sharing Strategy for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Sharing with Team

- **Post-Project Debriefs**:
  - Hold debriefs at the end of each major phase (Controller Development, Puppet Fabrication, Show Pipeline Setup).
  - Discuss what worked well, what failed, and what methods saved time or effort unexpectedly.

- **Workshops and Training Sessions**:
  - Convert firmware lessons, servo tuning methods, and animation-sync workflows into teachable content.
  - Record voiceover tutorials or screen captures of PCB/firmware design to be reused in future Control Freaks projects.

- **Documentation of Learnings**:
  - Maintain a shared Obsidian folder: `Resources/Control Freaks/Knowledge Base/`.
  - Summarize lessons from failures (e.g., servo noise, frame tolerance mismatches, or misaligned pivots).

### Sharing with Stakeholders

- **Project Reports and Case Studies**:
  - Compile a final public-facing report documenting project scope, phases, key builds, and postmortem conclusions.
  - Prepare a short version suitable for YouTube community posts and patrons.

- **Presentations and Meetings**:
  - Share results at open maker-space nights or a local tech meetup.
  - Present the puppet and control system at UFV‚Äôs end-of-semester engineering showcase.

- **Feedback Loops**:
  - Use YouTube comments, email replies, and GitHub issues to gather real-world feedback.
  - Analyze user feedback to iterate design for future open-source kits or educational use.

### Utilizing Digital Platforms

- **Internal Communication Channels**:
  - Use Obsidian as the knowledge hub, synced with GitHub for public tracking of versions.
  - Link entries to related hardware/software repos for traceable evolution of designs.

- **Online Forums and Discussion Groups**:
  - Post deconstructed lessons or workflow demos on Reddit (e.g., r/robotics, r/diy) or Hackaday.io.
  - Encourage peer critique and Q&A based on shared puppet animation setups or controller board design.

### Encouraging a Culture of Sharing

- **Incentives for Knowledge Contribution**:
  - Tag lessons learned with emoji stamps in Obsidian to gamify progress and learning consistency.
  - Reward self with milestone-based hardware upgrades or display features.

- **Leadership Role in Knowledge Sharing**:
  - Lead by publishing first full build logs and lessons learned, including errors and workarounds.
  - Show transparency in early failures to model open-source learning culture.

### Continuous Learning

- **Regular Learning Sessions**:
  - Schedule a Friday night ‚Äúretrospective‚Äù log after each key puppet or controller build checkpoint.
  - Use those sessions to extract a ‚Äúkey insight of the week‚Äù for digital publishing.

- **Cross-Project Learning Initiatives**:
  - Apply learnings from this puppet to future animatronic characters (e.g., more degrees of freedom, less bulk).
  - Share techniques on building flexible design systems that adapt to character changes.
