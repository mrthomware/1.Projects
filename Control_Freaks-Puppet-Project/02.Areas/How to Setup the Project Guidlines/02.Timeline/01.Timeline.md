# 📆 Project Timeline – Control Freaks Vault

## 🧩 Project Overview

- **Project Start Date**: 2025-06-10  
- **Projected End Date**: 2025-10-31  

This project is divided into three consecutive phases to accommodate a solo workflow:  
1. **Controller Development**  
2. **Puppet Development**  
3. **YouTube Channel Development**

All tasks are executed in a strictly sequential manner—no concurrency assumed.
