## 📌 Task Detail Highlights

- **CD-T03** ensures schematic design is electronically sound before progressing to fabrication.
- **CD-T13** focuses on tight audio-motion timing logic, critical for lip-sync animation.
- **PD-T06–PD-T07** improve mechanical reliability and visual quality through finishing and painting.
- **SP-T04** generates detailed cue sheets for syncing servo gestures with dialogue lines.
- **SP-T11** enhances accessibility via captions — important for content professionalism.
- **OV-T03** formalizes your technical knowledge into reusable internal standards.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- All tasks must be completed **strictly in sequence** — solo developer constraint prohibits any parallel tasking.
- Weekly review every **Sunday evening** is required for status, delay assessment, and scope creep management.
- Any deviation or delay must be recorded in the `Dataview logs`, including reason and adjusted target dates.
- Documentation and templates will be **converted into reusable formats** for future puppet projects.
- The project is not considered complete until **OV-T08** is signed off and archived.
