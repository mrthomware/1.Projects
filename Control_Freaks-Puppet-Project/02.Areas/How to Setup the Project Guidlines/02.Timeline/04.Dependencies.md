Here is the **Task Dependencies** section tailored for the **Control Freaks Vault** animatronic development project. It uses both a clear table and a visual Mermaid-based network to highlight how each task relies on others within the puppet production pipeline:

## ğŸ”— Task Dependencies â€“ Control Freaks Vault

Understanding task dependencies ensures we sequence activities correctly and avoid bottlenecks during fabrication, programming, and content creation.

### ğŸ“Š Tabular Representation

| Dependent Task (X) | Dependency (Y) | Description of Dependency                                     |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| T02 â€“ CAD Modeling | T01 â€“ Sketches | CAD work begins after sketch designs are finalized.            |
| T03 â€“ 3D Printing  | T02 â€“ CAD      | Physical parts printed only after 3D models are complete.      |
| T04 â€“ Assembly     | T03 â€“ Printing | Assembly requires printed parts to be ready.                   |
| T05 â€“ Electronics  | T04 â€“ Assembly | Wiring takes place after puppet skeleton is physically built.  |
| T06 â€“ Programming  | T05 â€“ Electronics | Servo scripting depends on tested electronics.              |
| T07 â€“ Animation Sync | T06 â€“ Programming | Animation tests require motor control functions to be complete. |
| T09 â€“ Scene Recording | T07 â€“ Animation Sync | Scenes can be recorded only after puppet animation logic is validated. |
| T10 â€“ Audio Design | T08 â€“ Storyboard | Audio production aligns with storyboarded scenes.             |
| T11 â€“ Video Edit   | T09, T10       | Editing begins after scenes and audio are ready.              |
| T12 â€“ Upload       | T11 â€“ Final Edit | Final output must be rendered before release.               |

### ğŸ§  Types of Dependencies Used

- **FS (Finish-to-Start)**: Most of our dependencies follow FS logic â€“ a task begins only once the prior finishes.
- **SS (Start-to-Start)**: Tasks T09 and T10 may overlap once storyboards are done.
- **FF (Finish-to-Finish)**: T11 must finish only after T09 and T10 finish.

### ğŸ§­ Critical Path

- **T01 â†’ T02 â†’ T03 â†’ T04 â†’ T05 â†’ T06 â†’ T07 â†’ T09 â†’ T11 â†’ T12**

These tasks directly determine the overall project duration. Any delay in this chain will delay the final deliverable.

### ğŸ”„ Review and Adjustment

* Dependencies are reviewed weekly during sprint reviews.
* Any changes to upstream task deadlines automatically prompt downstream reassessment and are logged in `Change_Log.md`.

**Note**: Visual dependencies are also mirrored in the Gantt chart found in `Timeline.md` for cross-referencing sequence and critical path impacts.
