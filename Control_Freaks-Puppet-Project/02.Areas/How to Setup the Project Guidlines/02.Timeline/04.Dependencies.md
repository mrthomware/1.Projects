# 🔗 Task Dependencies – Control Freaks Vault

A clear overview of how each task depends on the successful completion of previous steps in the Control Freaks Puppet Project pipeline. Ensures precise execution flow and helps identify bottlenecks before they occur.

## 📊 Tabular Representation

| Dependent Task      | Depends On         | Description of Dependency                                           |
|---------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CD-T02 – Schematic Design | CD-T01 – Block Diagram         | Circuit design begins after block diagram planning.                 |

## 🧠 Types of Dependencies Used

- **FS – Finish-to-Start**: Primary model; one task begins only when the previous finishes.
- **FF – Finish-to-Finish**: Used sparingly; applied to SP-T11 and SP-T12 (must finish together).
- **SS – Start-to-Start**: Only used between rehearsal and audio (SP-T05 & SP-T08) if simultaneous testing is viable.

---

## 🧭 Critical Path

The following is the **strict critical path**, meaning any delay here directly delays the final project:

> **CD-T01 → CD-T14 → PD-T01 → PD-T12 → SP-T01 → SP-T14 → OV-T08**

## 🔄 Review and Adjustment

* Dependencies are reviewed weekly during Sunday project audits.
* Any upstream changes trigger a cascading update through `05.Timeline.md` and `06.Risk_Management.md`.
* Affected tasks are logged with impact notes in `Change_Log.md`.
