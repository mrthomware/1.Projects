### **3. Detailed Notes**

**Phase 1: Planning**  
- **Key Considerations:** Establish character, expression range, and emotional appeal  
- **Dependencies:** Requires concept lock before CAD  
- **Risks:** Late creative divergence  
- **Contingencies:** Allow early redraws or reuse archived designs

**Phase 2: Design & CAD**  
- **Key Considerations:** Servo alignment, hinge tolerance, cable channels  
- **Dependencies:** Requires finished sketches  
- **Risks:** CAD revision cycle bottleneck  
- **Contingencies:** Print non-critical parts first; adjust later parts as needed

**Phase 3: Fabrication & Build**  
- **Key Considerations:** Print durability, smooth servo operation  
- **Dependencies:** CAD models and STL verification  
- **Risks:** Print failures, supply shortages  
- **Contingencies:** Backup filament on hand; alternate printer reservation

**Phase 4: Programming & Testing**  
- **Key Considerations:** Servo library compatibility, PWM timing accuracy  
- **Dependencies:** Assembled skeleton, wired electronics  
- **Risks:** Servo burn-out or miscalibration  
- **Contingencies:** Use test-rig before mounting into puppet

**Phase 5: Content Production**  
- **Key Considerations:** Lighting, framing, puppet reach range  
- **Dependencies:** Motion scripts and voiceovers  
- **Risks:** Camera sync errors, puppeteer coordination  
- **Contingencies:** Record multiple takes; backup audio with sync cues

**Phase 6: Deployment and Closure**  
- **Key Considerations:** Rendering speed, upload integrity, channel metadata  
- **Dependencies:** Footage and sound mix  
- **Risks:** Last-minute audio or subtitle issues  
- **Contingencies:** Emergency subtitle overlay template and edit macros
