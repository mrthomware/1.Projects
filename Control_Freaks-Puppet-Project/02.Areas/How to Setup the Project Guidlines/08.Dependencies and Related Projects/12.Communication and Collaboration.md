# Communication and Collaboration

- **Channels and Meetings**: Establish communication channels and regular updates with related projects.

---

Effective communication and collaboration are vital for the *Control Freaks Puppet Project*, especially due to its interconnected components‚Äîhardware development, puppet design, storytelling workflow, and Obsidian documentation. These parts, while sequential, share resources, timelines, and information that must be consistently synchronized. This document outlines how communication and collaboration will be maintained across related sub-projects and external touchpoints.

## Communication and Collaboration Strategy for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Establishing Communication Channels

- **Selection of Channels**:
  - Internal development notes, updates, and planning will be tracked using **Obsidian**, with Dataview dashboards for task updates and status.
  - Version-controlled assets (e.g., code, 3D models, designs) will be stored on **GitHub**.
  - External references and documentation will be managed using **Google Docs** (for shared access with collaborators or advisors, if applicable).

- **Centralized Communication Hub**:
  - Obsidian will serve as the **primary project hub**, using foldered notes (`/02.Areas/How to Setup the Project Guidelines/`) for logs, reviews, and updates.
  - YAML-linked daily notes will facilitate temporal tracking and status reviews.

---

### Structuring Regular Meetings

- **Cross-Component Checkpoints**:
  - Every project phase (Controller, Puppet, Pipeline, Vault Integration) will include an **internal weekly review**, scheduled on Sundays.
  - Use Obsidian note `Weekly_Review.md` to summarize progress, blockers, and next steps.

- **Agendas and Minutes**:
  - Maintain structured note templates for each checkpoint review. All major technical decisions or deviations will be logged in `Retrospective.md`.

---

### Collaboration Practices

- **Joint Planning Sessions**:
  - Integrated planning is achieved through a unified `Project Gantt Chart (mermaid)` that visualizes sequential dependencies and phase transitions.

- **Shared Goals and Milestones**:
  - Key milestones like "Controller PCB complete" or "Storyboard draft finalized" are shared across multiple sub-phases and drive alignment between engineering and storytelling workflows.

---

### Information Sharing

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Status summaries and decision logs are embedded in Obsidian's `Phase Logs` under each project folder:
    - `/Projects/Controller Development/`
    - `/Projects/Puppet Development/`
    - `/Projects/Show Pipeline/`
    - `/Projects/Vault Integration/`

- **Knowledge Sharing Platforms**:
  - Technical solutions (like firmware bug fixes or mechanical linkage optimizations) will be posted to a future *Control Freaks DevLog* folder for reuse across projects.

---

### Collaboration Tools

- **Project Management Tools**:
  - Kanban-style organization using `kanban-plugin` in Obsidian for real-time task tracking.
  - Mermaid-based Gantt charts are embedded in `Timeline.md`.

- **Digital Workspaces**:
  - Obsidian's folder structure mirrors the PARA framework to allow cross-linking, referencing, and embedded assets across all phases.

---

### Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

- **Conflict Management Plan**:
  - All scheduling or design conflicts will be flagged during weekly reviews.
  - Backlog prioritization and scope reduction are the primary resolution strategies, with notes preserved in `Scope_Notes.md`.

- **Mediation and Escalation Processes**:
  - If conflicts persist, a `Decision_Log.md` will record trade-off analyses, rationale, and final outcomes for clarity and traceability.

---

### Reporting and Documentation

- **Integrated Reporting**:
  - Unified dashboards are generated via Obsidian's Dataview and manually maintained Gantt visuals.
  - Project summaries are posted monthly in `Project_Status_Report.md`.

- **Record-Keeping**:
  - All files are versioned and referenced in the project‚Äôs PARA archive structure.
  - Design files, firmware builds, and reviews are embedded directly into their respective project folders.

---

### Review and Feedback

- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - Regular retrospectives are performed at each major milestone.
  - Post-milestone debriefs documented in `Retrospective.md` will inform design and scheduling adjustments.

---

Maintaining strong, systematized communication and collaboration across the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* ensures smooth handoffs between project phases, reduces rework, and supports the overarching brand and technical development goals. This approach also scales well for future collaborators or when archiving the project as a public-facing case study or portfolio entry.
