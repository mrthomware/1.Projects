# Reporting and Escalation Procedures

- **Procedures for Multi-Project Issues**: Set up reporting and escalation processes.

---
Effective reporting and escalation procedures are essential for managing the *Control Freaks Puppet Project*, which consists of four sequential and interrelated parts:

1. **Controller Development**
2. **Puppet Development**
3. **Show Pipeline Development**
4. **Obsidian Vault Integration**

As a solo developer, creating a lightweight but structured system for identifying, reporting, and escalating project-wide issues is crucial for timely intervention and maintaining workflow integrity.

## Reporting and Escalation Procedures for Multi-Phase Issues in Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Establishing Reporting Protocols

- **Weekly Reporting Log**:
  - Maintain a `Weekly_Report.md` file in each phase folder with a section titled ‚ÄúMulti-Phase Concerns.‚Äù
  - Include: issue description, suspected impact, notes on root cause, and proposed mitigation.

- **Standard Report Format**:
  - Use consistent YAML front matter and headings:
    ```yaml
    ---
    issue_id: CFV-MP-##
    phase: "Controller Development"
    type: "Cross-Phase Delay"
    severity: "High"
    status: "Pending"
    ---
    ```

---

### Designating Responsibility

- **Designated Review Day**:
  - Allocate one day per week (e.g., Sunday Review Session) to review outstanding cross-phase concerns.
  
- **Digital Workspace Tracking**:
  - Use a centralized markdown index (e.g., `project-issues-index.md`) that links to all unresolved issues across phases.

---

### Escalation Procedures

- **Escalation Criteria**:
  - Escalate issues if:
    - Delay exceeds buffer time
    - Hardware assumptions affect Puppet Design
    - Data misalignment impacts Show Pipeline scripting

- **Escalation Workflow**:
  - If a task from one phase causes a blocker in the next:
    1. Create an `escalation-log.md` entry.
    2. Move the current task status to `#blocked`.
    3. Add a temporary patch task (e.g., `CD-T09a: Interim Wiring Fix`).

---

### Cross-Phase Collaboration

- **Unified Planning Sessions**:
  - At the end of each phase, conduct a self-review with a section: "Interphase Handoff Issues".
  - Prepare checklist items for the next phase using the final notes from the previous one.

- **Joint Issue Notes**:
  - For complex issues, write joint notes like `CD+PD_Conflict-Note.md` explaining interdependencies.

---

### Documentation and Follow-Up

- **Issue Lifecycle Tags**:
  - Use consistent tags for each issue lifecycle: `#identified`, `#escalated`, `#in-review`, `#resolved`.

- **Post-Resolution Section**:
  - At the end of each issue note, include a section:
    ```
    ## Lessons Learned
    - [ ] Add test pins to future controller PCBs
    - [ ] Separate rigging from electronics setup day
    ```

---

### Risk Management Integration

- **Linked to Risk Register**:
  - All escalated items should be cross-referenced in the Risk Register (`risk-register.md`) under "Phase Interference Risks."

- **Pre-Issue Monitoring**:
  - Create ‚Äúwatch points‚Äù in Gantt chart notes for predicted tight transitions (e.g., PCB shipping vs. puppet rig setup).

---

### Training and Awareness

- **Conflict and Issue Templates**:
  - Use `issue-report-template.md` and `escalation-template.md` in every phase folder.
  
- **Checklists for Phase Closeout**:
  - Include a checklist item: ‚ÄúWere any multi-project issues unresolved? If yes, log before proceeding.‚Äù

---

### Continuous Improvement

- **Quarterly Process Review**:
  - Every 3 months, evaluate:
    - Number of escalations
    - Resolution efficiency
    - Preventable recurrences
  - Log changes in `escalation-process-changelog.md`

---

By applying structured reporting and escalation procedures to the *Control Freaks Puppet Project*, even as a solo developer, you can maintain clarity and accountability across all four interconnected phases. This system enhances traceability, ensures proper phase transitions, and provides early warnings for any disruptions that could compromise the sequential timeline.
