# Integrated Planning

- **Efficiency and Cohesion**: Where possible, coordinate planning with related projects.

---

Integrated planning in the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* is essential for maximizing solo developer efficiency across the project's interconnected phases: Controller Development, Puppet Development, Show Pipeline, and Vault Integration. By aligning planning structures, resources, and objectives across all sub-projects, this strategy ensures cohesion and smooth transitions from one phase to another.

## Integrated Planning for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Identifying Integration Opportunities

- **Project Overlap and Synergies**:
  - Hardware decisions in *Controller Development* impact available movement types in *Puppet Development*.
  - *Show Pipeline Development* relies on outputs from both hardware and puppet structure, requiring synchronized planning.
  - Vault structure from *Obsidian Integration* must accommodate logs, files, and progress tracking from all three technical domains.

- **Synergy Assessment**:
  - Combining setup tasks (e.g., GitHub repo, Obsidian structure) benefits all project phases.
  - YAML standardization allows for cross-phase dataview queries, improving traceability.

---

### Coordinated Planning Process

- **Joint Planning Sessions**:
  - Conduct unified task planning during weekly planning review (`Weekly_Review.md`) to reassess dependencies and next-step priorities.
  - Update shared Milestone document to reflect timeline changes across all sub-phases.

- **Consolidated Timeline Development**:
  - Maintain a master Gantt chart using Mermaid syntax that reflects strict sequential execution (solo developer constraint).
  - All four project phases appear as interrelated sections within a single visual timeline.

---

### Resource Sharing and Allocation

- **Resource Pooling**:
  - Hardware components (e.g., microcontrollers, servos) used in testing can serve multiple prototypes with careful scheduling.
  - Design assets (e.g., character rigs, CAD templates) are shared across puppet models.

- **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms for Resources**:
  - When resource bottlenecks occur, priority is determined based on current milestone proximity or long-lead dependencies (e.g., PCB manufacturing delays).

---

### Stakeholder Engagement

- **Unified Stakeholder Strategy**:
  - As a solo developer, stakeholder roles include your future self, reviewers, YouTube audience, and collaborators. Document expectations and deliverables from each ‚Äústakeholder‚Äù in the stakeholder log.
  - Shared expectations should be embedded in public documents such as GitHub README and video outlines.

---

### Risk Management

- **Cross-Project Risk Assessment**:
  - Delays in controller firmware could block downstream animation testing.
  - Obsidian Vault misconfiguration could hinder proper documentation and Dataview-based reporting.

- **Integrated Risk Mitigation Plans**:
  - Build testing jigs and mock interfaces early to reduce bottlenecks.
  - Integrate test cases and auto-documentation scripts for recurring tasks.

---

### Communication and Collaboration

- **Regular Cross-Project Reviews**:
  - Weekly reviews include updates across all phases using a unified Kanban system in Obsidian (Kanban plugin).
  - Visual indicators for blocked tasks due to inter-phase dependencies are added.

- **Collaborative Tools**:
  - Obsidian, GitHub, and Fritzing/Blender folders follow a synced naming convention to allow mirrored cross-reference.

---

### Documentation and Reporting

- **Integrated Reporting System**:
  - Maintain a central reporting log (`Control_Freaks_Project_Overview.md`) summarizing progress in each project phase.
  - Each task file (`CD-T01.md`, `PD-T03.md`, etc.) links to the master dashboard via tags and backlinks.

- **Document Sharing and Access**:
  - Vault folder `/02.Areas/How to Setup the Project Guidlines` is reserved for unified project methodology and policies.

---

### Continuous Review and Adaptation

- **Regular Review Sessions**:
  - End-of-week review includes section: ‚ÄúCross-Phase Integration Check‚Äù to capture new inter-phase dependencies or conflicts.

- **Feedback Mechanism**:
  - Maintain a `Retrospective.md` document that tracks weekly issues, successes, and proposed integration adjustments.
  - Lessons learned from misalignments are converted into checklist items in future task templates.

---

Integrated planning across the Control Freaks Puppet Project ensures that no phase becomes a silo. By weaving all sub-projects into one cohesive execution plan, you reduce friction, increase reuse, and maintain strategic alignment throughout the build, testing, and storytelling pipeline.
