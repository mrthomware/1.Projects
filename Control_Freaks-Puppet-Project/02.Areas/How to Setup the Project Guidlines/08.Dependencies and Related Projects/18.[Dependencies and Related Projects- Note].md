### Key Dependencies

#### Internal Dependencies
- **Dependency 1**: PCB Fabrication Turnaround  
  - **Description**: Timely completion of PCB production and delivery for the servo controller.  
  - **Impact on Project**: Delays would stall controller testing and firmware development.  
  - **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware  
  - **Status**: In Progress

- **Dependency 2**: 3D Printing Access  
  - **Description**: Access to shared campus 3D printers for puppet components.  
  - **Impact on Project**: Delays in printing can hold up physical prototyping.  
  - **Responsible Party**: UFV MakerSpace Coordinator  
  - **Status**: Scheduled

#### External Dependencies
- **Dependency 1**: Audio Playback Module Delivery  
  - **Description**: Pre-built audio boards sourced from a third-party vendor for puppet mouth sync.  
  - **Impact on Project**: Delays would affect the integration and show testing phase.  
  - **Responsible Party**: Procurement / Thomas Ware  
  - **Status**: Awaiting shipment

- **Dependency 2**: Grant Approval for Materials Budget  
  - **Description**: Waiting for student innovation grant confirmation to purchase puppeteering hardware.

### Related Projects

#### Project 1
- **Project Name**: Obsidian Vault Integration Project  
- **Description**: Builds the documentation and control structure inside Obsidian for the full Control Freaks pipeline.  
- **Interrelation**: Shares planning timelines, task tracking, and documentation responsibilities.  
- **Coordination Requirements**: Sync review points and update cycles; cross-link YAML fields.

#### Project 2
- **Project Name**: Flex Sync Animation Demo  
- **Description**: A standalone proof-of-concept test rig to demonstrate sync between audio and servo motion.  
- **Interrelation**: Relies on the same controller firmware and audio board design.  
- **Coordination Requirements**: Testing schedules must follow controller development milestones.

### Review and Adjustment Process
- **Review Schedule**: Weekly review during project stand-ups.  
- **Adjustment Protocol**: Adjustments initiated by the Project Manager, logged in the Obsidian task register, and discussed in weekly reviews.

---

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies

- **Risk 1**: PCB Vendor Delay  
  - **Description**: Delay in PCB delivery could halt controller testing.  
  - **Mitigation**: Have backup vendor options ready and stagger orders.

- **Risk 2**: Scheduling Conflict with Shared 3D Printers  
  - **Description**: Campus 3D printer schedule is overbooked.  
  - **Mitigation**: Pre-book slots weekly; investigate home print alternative.
