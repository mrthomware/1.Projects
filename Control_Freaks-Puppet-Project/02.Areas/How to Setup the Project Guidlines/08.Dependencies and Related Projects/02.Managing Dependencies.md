# Managing Dependencies

### Task Dependencies

- **Types of Dependencies**:
  - **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: Firmware development cannot begin until PCB assembly is complete.
  - **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Puppet sculpting and puppet painting may begin simultaneously.
  - **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Final system integration and final testing must complete together.
  - **Start-to-Finish (SF)**: Final review of documentation may only complete once user demo testing begins.

- **Documentation**:
  - All dependencies are mapped in the project's Gantt chart (`/01.Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/06.Visuals/Gantt_Timeline.mmd`).
  - Dependencies are tracked using link references in Obsidian (via `dataview` relationships between tasks).

---

### Resource Dependencies

- **Assessment**:
  - Solo developer constraint mandates serialized access to core tools (e.g., soldering station, CAD workstation).
  - Many tools used in controller development are also required later in puppet mechanical tuning.

- **Shared Resources**:
  - Shared access across different puppet builds, controller boards, and scripting phases is tracked in `Shared_Resource_Chart.md`.
  - Arduino-based debug tools are reused across multiple hardware verification stages.

---

### External Dependencies

- **Identification**:
  - Specialty servo motors from Pololu Robotics.
  - Audio VO lines from a remote collaborator.
  - Packaging supplies from external suppliers for demo showcase kit.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Procurement timelines monitored weekly.
  - Dependency trackers maintained in `External_Dependencies_Log.md` and visually updated via Kanban in Obsidian.

---

### Sequential and Concurrent Activities

- **Analysis**:
  - Controller Development tasks are all strictly sequential due to hardware-software iteration loops.
  - Puppet skin painting may proceed in parallel with voice recording without conflict.

- **Scheduling Impact**:
  - Sequential scheduling extends full development time but ensures no deadlocks in solo resource use.
  - Visual task planner reflects sequence enforcement (`/Tasks/Control_Freaks_Timeline.md`).

---

### Dependency Risk Management

- **Risk Identification**:
  - High risk in firmware finalization depending on completion of audio sync testing.
  - Puppet rig testing blocked by servo delivery timeline.

- **Contingency Plans**:
  - Placeholder firmware mocks created to begin servo movement testing before audio VO arrival.
  - Alternate puppet control mode using manual test rig if servo boards are delayed.

---

### Communication and Collaboration

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Weekly summary updates stored in `Weekly_Project_Updates.md`.
  - Changes to dependency-critical paths are logged and flagged in all linked MOCs and task notes.

- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**:
  - Use of `Issue Tracker` in the Vault to flag dependency-related risks.
  - Open forum with collaborators via Discord for time-sensitive blockers.

---

### Review and Adaptation

- **Ongoing Review**:
  - Dependencies reviewed at the end of each task milestone or when a delay is logged.
  - Timeline adjusted based on material availability or skill completion.

- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Post-milestone retrospectives assess causes of delay and dependency resolution effectiveness.
  - Lessons learned compiled into `Retrospective_Summary_Log.md`.

Managing dependencies effectively in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** is fundamental to ensuring the project advances on time and within scope. Given the solo development constraint and the heavy reuse of limited resources, these dependency mappings allow for proactive conflict resolution and task pacing while maintaining flexibility for external factors.
