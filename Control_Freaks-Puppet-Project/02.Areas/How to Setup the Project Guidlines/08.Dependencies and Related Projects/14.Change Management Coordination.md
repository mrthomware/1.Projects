# Change Management Coordination

- **Impact of Changes**: Coordinate change management across interrelated projects.

---

Coordinating change management across interdependent phases of the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* is essential to maintain system coherence and timeline stability. Given the project's phased structure‚Äîspanning controller design, puppet hardware, content pipelines, and documentation‚Äîany change in one area can cascade across others. This section outlines the approach to ensuring synchronized and low-risk change implementation.

## Change Management Coordination for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Understanding Inter-Project Dependencies

- **Dependency Mapping**:  
  - Map dependencies between the four major project phases:
    - `Controller Development` ‚Üî `Puppet Development` (physical compatibility, signal routing)
    - `Puppet Development` ‚Üî `Show Pipeline Development` (mechanical constraints vs animation demands)
    - `Controller Development` ‚Üî `Obsidian Vault Integration` (firmware logs, reference data for documentation)
  - Visualize dependencies using Obsidian backlinks and mermaid diagrams stored in `/02.Areas/.../Dependencies.md`.

---

### Coordinated Change Assessment

- **Cross-Phase Impact Evaluation**:  
  - Evaluate every proposed change (e.g., switching a servo type) for its impact on:
    - Mechanical assembly
    - Firmware pinout
    - Performance testing schedule
    - Documentation templates
  - Log assessments in `Change_Impact_Log.md`.

- **Joint Impact Analysis**:  
  - Review high-risk changes during milestone retrospectives or weekly reviews.
  - Involve all relevant stakeholders before proceeding (even for solo projects, this means taking a deliberate decision-review loop).

---

### Communication and Collaboration

- **Change Review Schedule**:  
  - Designate Fridays as the official day for cross-phase change evaluation and synchronization.

- **Change Planning Workshops**:  
  - Simulate group collaboration by maintaining structured planning notes in `Change_Discussion.md`.

---

### Integrated Change Approval Process

- **Approval Mechanism**:  
  - No change shall be applied without:
    1. Documentation of its rationale in `Decision_Log.md`
    2. Impact assessment across at least two dependent project areas
    3. A signed-off note (self-approved, but with versioned tracking)

- **Transparency and Logging**:  
  - Use YAML block in each affected note to indicate change history and relevant review reference.

---

### Synchronized Implementation of Changes

- **Timeline Coordination**:  
  - Apply changes in a "cascaded freeze" system:
    - Freeze upstream first (e.g., controller pinout).
    - Apply downstream updates (e.g., CAD harness, show rig scripting) after validation.

- **Buffer Period for Testing**:  
  - Schedule a 1‚Äì2 day buffer after major changes to validate effects across subsystems.

---

### Monitoring and Evaluation

- **Post-Change Monitoring**:  
  - Log issues, bugs, or rework effort post-change in `Change_Performance_Log.md`.

- **Review Sessions**:  
  - At each milestone, evaluate:
    - Number of changes made
    - Rollback occurrences
    - Documentation accuracy post-change

---

### Risk Management and Contingency Planning

- **Change Risk Registry**:  
  - Track risky change proposals separately with their rollback plans.
  - Maintain a `Change_Risks.md` file with:
    - Risk ID
    - Triggering condition
    - Severity score
    - Pre-approved rollback steps

- **Agile Response**:  
  - Set rules for rapid rollback (e.g., ‚Äúrevert servo driver change within 24 hours if PWM jitter exceeds threshold‚Äù).

---

### Documentation and Reporting

- **Centralized Change Log**:  
  - Maintain `/02.Areas/How to Setup the Project Guidelines/Change_Management_Log.md` to track:
    - Who initiated change
    - Dependencies affected
    - Final result

- **Stakeholder Reporting**:  
  - Summarize change activity in `Weekly_Review.md` with a section titled `Change Summary`.

---

Coordinated change management ensures that updates in one phase of the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* do not disrupt the functionality, schedule, or design intent of other components. It enforces discipline in tracking, analysis, and post-change validation‚Äîcreating a resilient solo-developer workflow for managing complexity.
