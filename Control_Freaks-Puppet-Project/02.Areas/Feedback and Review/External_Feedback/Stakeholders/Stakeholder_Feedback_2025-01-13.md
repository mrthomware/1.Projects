## **2. Feedback Details**

### **A. Design**
| **Stakeholder**     | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Stakeholder A       | The puppet’s facial expressions need to be more engaging and dynamic.        | Update designs to include a broader range of expressions. | In Progress       |
| Stakeholder B       | The "Mad Scientist" theme is missing unique props that reinforce the concept. | Add quirky props like bubbling beakers and floating gadgets. | Not Started       |

### **B. Animation**
| **Stakeholder**     | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Stakeholder A       | Gestures feel rushed; adjust timing for smoother transitions.                | Refine animation curves in Blender.             | Pending Review    |
| Stakeholder C       | Walk cycles should include more personality to reflect the puppet’s theme.   | Experiment with whimsical and confident strides. | In Progress       |

### **C. Prototyping**
| **Stakeholder**     | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Stakeholder B       | The joints in the physical prototype feel too loose; improve stability.      | Tighten joint mechanics in the prototype.       | Not Started       |
| Stakeholder C       | Materials for the prototype should be more durable for repeated use.        | Source stronger materials and test.             | Pending           |
