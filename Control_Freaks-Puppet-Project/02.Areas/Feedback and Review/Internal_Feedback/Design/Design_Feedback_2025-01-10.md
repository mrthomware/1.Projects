### **A. Visual Design**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|

| Reviewer B           | The color palette feels too muted for a whimsical design.                   | Revise the color scheme to incorporate brighter tones. | Pending           |

### **B. Proportions**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer A           | The puppet’s head should be slightly larger for better expressiveness.      | Adjust proportions in sketches and 3D models.   | In Progress       |
| Reviewer C           | Hands appear too small for functional articulation.                         | Refine hand proportions for better balance.     | Not Started       |

### **C. Material Choices**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
