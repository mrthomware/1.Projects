## **2. Feedback Details**

### **A. General Animation**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer A           | Movements lack fluidity in transitions between gestures.                    | Refine keyframe interpolation for smoother transitions. | In Progress       |
| Reviewer B           | Pacing feels inconsistent; some actions are rushed while others are too slow.| Adjust animation timing and pacing curves.      | Pending           |

### **B. Facial Animation**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer A           | Lip-sync needs refinement to align better with dialogue.                    | Adjust timing to improve lip-sync accuracy.     | Not Started       |
| Reviewer C           | Eyebrow movements feel static; add more subtle expressions.                 | Add dynamic eyebrow animations for realism.     | In Progress       |

### **C. Secondary Motion**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer B           | Accessories like goggles and props should move more naturally.              | Add physics-based secondary motion.             | Not Started       |
| Reviewer C           | Hair movement appears stiff during fast actions.                            | Refine physics settings for more natural flow.  | Pending           |

## **3. Summary of Actions**
1. Refine keyframe interpolation to ensure smooth gesture transitions.
2. Adjust animation timing and pacing for consistency.
3. Enhance facial animations, focusing on lip-sync and eyebrow movements.
4. Add secondary motion to accessories and hair for realism.

---

## **4. Notes and Observations**
- Animators emphasized the importance of secondary motion in creating lifelike animations.
- Iterative reviews are essential to fine-tune gestures and timing.
