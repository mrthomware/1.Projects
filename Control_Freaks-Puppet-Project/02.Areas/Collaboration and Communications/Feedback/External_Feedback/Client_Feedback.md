# **Client Feedback Log**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design
### **Version:** [Insert Version Number]

---

## **1. Feedback Summary**
This document compiles feedback from the client regarding various aspects of the **3D Puppet Design** project. The feedback has been categorized for actionable clarity and aligned with the project phases.

## **2. Feedback Details**

### **A. Concept Development**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Client A            | Preferred whimsical themes with bright, vibrant colors.                     | Update mood boards to reflect brighter themes.  | In Progress       |
| [Insert Date]  | Client B            | Requested more diverse material references for physical prototyping.        | Add metallic and fabric textures.              | Completed         |

### **B. 3D Modeling**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Client C            | The puppet’s proportions are slightly off; adjust the head-to-body ratio.    | Refine base model proportions.                 | In Progress       |
| [Insert Date]  | Client A            | The textures are overly complex; simplify for an educational audience.      | Simplify material details.                     | Pending           |

### **C. Animation**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Client A            | Lip-sync timing needs improvement for smoother dialogue alignment.           | Adjust timing and test with voiceover.         | Pending Review    |
| [Insert Date]  | Client B            | The puppet’s gestures appear rushed; slow down pacing for clarity.          | Refine animation timing.                       | Not Started       |

### **D. Prototyping**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Client C            | The 3D printed prototype is too fragile; explore stronger materials.         | Source higher-quality materials.               | Pending           |
| [Insert Date]  | Client A            | The physical joints are too loose, reducing stability.                       | Tighten joint mechanics in design.             | In Progress       |

## **3. Summary of Actions**
1. Incorporate feedback into mood boards and 3D designs.
2. Refine animations to match client expectations.
3. Test and iterate on prototype materials and mechanics.

---

## **4. Notes and Observations**
- Clients emphasize a need for simplicity and functionality in design.
- Feedback iterations are crucial for aligning deliverables with expectations.
