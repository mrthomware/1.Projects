# 🔄 Post-Session Activities

Following up effectively on a brainstorming session ensures that the ideas generated lead to tangible outcomes that support the project’s progress.

  Use clear metrics such as:

## 📋 2. Follow-Up Actions

  Assign owners for each follow-up task. Use a Kanban board or task tracker if applicable.
