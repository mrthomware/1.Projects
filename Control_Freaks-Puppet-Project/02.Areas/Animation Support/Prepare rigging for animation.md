### **Task Card: Prepare Rigging for Animation**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

#### **Task Description**

Prepare the 3D puppet model for animation by creating a rig that allows smooth articulation and realistic movements. This involves defining a bone structure, control points, and ensuring the model is fully compatible with animation tools.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Prepare the Model**
    
    - Ensure the model is finalized, with clean topology and proper symmetry.
    - Confirm the model is scaled correctly and aligned to the origin point.
2. **Define the Skeleton**
    
    - Create a hierarchical bone structure for all articulation points:
        - Head, arms, fingers, legs, and torso.
        - Secondary features (e.g., eyelids, jaw, or props).
    - Use tools like Blender’s Armature or Maya’s Skeleton Setup.
3. **Add Inverse Kinematics (IK) and Forward Kinematics (FK)**
    
    - Apply IK for natural limb movement (e.g., walking, waving).
    - Use FK for precise control over joint rotations (e.g., turning the head).
4. **Set Up Control Handles**
    
    - Add user-friendly control rigs for animators to manipulate:
        - Custom shapes or widgets for easier selection.
        - Control points for eyes, fingers, and mouth movements.
5. **Skin the Model**
    
    - Bind the skeleton to the 3D model (skinning).
    - Ensure proper weight painting:
        - Smooth transitions between joints.
        - Avoid deformations during movement (e.g., pinching or stretching).
6. **Test the Rig**
    
    - Apply test animations to check:
        - Range of motion.
        - Stability and responsiveness of controls.
        - Correct deformations.
    - Tools: Use built-in test rigs or create simple animations (e.g., waving, jumping).
7. **Iterate and Refine**
    
    - Adjust weight painting, joint placement, or control rigs based on test results.
    - Share the rigged model with stakeholders or animators for feedback.
8. **Export the Rigged Model**
    
    - Save the rigged model in compatible formats (e.g., `.fbx`, `.blend`, `.mb`).
    - Ensure proper organization of files and documentation for animators.

---

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Include a test animation showcasing the rig in action.
- Document the rigging process and list features for animators.

---

#### **Priority:**

High – Rigging is essential for ensuring the puppet is ready for animation.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** when rigging begins.
- **Review Column:** Share the rigged model and test animations for feedback.
- **Done Column:** Mark as completed once the rig is finalized and approved.
