### **Task Card: Review Rigging and Test Animations**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Conduct a review of the rigging setup and test animations for the 3D puppet model. Gather feedback on functionality, articulation, and movement quality, and refine the rig as needed.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Prepare the Rigged Model for Review**
    
    - Ensure the rigged model includes:
        - Bone structure for all articulation points.
        - Control handles for animation.
        - Proper weight painting for smooth deformations.
    - Create test animations to demonstrate:
        - Basic movements (e.g., head turns, arm raises, mouth movements).
        - Complex actions (e.g., walking, talking).
2. **Export Test Files**
    
    - Export test animations in shareable formats (e.g., `.mp4`, `.fbx`, `.blend`).
    - Include rendered videos or live demonstration files showcasing the rig's functionality.
3. **Schedule Review Session**
    
    - Invite stakeholders or team members to review the rigging and animations.
    - Provide access to test files or live demonstrations in advance.
4. **Facilitate Feedback Discussion**
    
    - Present the rigged model and test animations.
    - Highlight key features of the rig, such as articulation points and control setups.
    - Collect input on:
        - Movement smoothness and accuracy.
        - Range of motion and usability of controls.
        - Any issues or limitations observed.
5. **Document Feedback**
    
    - Record comments, suggestions, and concerns raised during the review.
    - Categorize feedback into:
        - **Critical Fixes:** Issues that affect functionality or usability.
        - **Enhancements:** Optional improvements to refine animation quality.
6. **Refine Rigging and Animations**
    
    - Make necessary adjustments to:
        - Weight painting and joint placements.
        - Control rig usability and functionality.
        - Test animations for smoother transitions.
7. **Finalize and Approve**
    
    - Share the updated rig and animations for final approval.
    - Confirm readiness for the next production phase.

---

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Include videos, images, or files showcasing the rig and test animations.
- Attach a feedback summary documenting issues and resolutions.

---

#### **Priority:**

High – Ensuring the rigging and animations are functional and approved is critical for further production stages.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** during the review process.
- **Review Column:** Address and refine based on feedback.
- **Done Column:** Mark as completed once the rigging and animations are finalized and approved.
