# **Script: Scene 02**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design
### **Scene Title:** Movement Showcase

---

## **1. Scene Overview**
**Objective:** Highlight the puppet’s articulation and range of motion by showcasing fluid and dynamic movements. This scene emphasizes the technical quality of the rigging and animation.

---

## **2. Script Details**

### **Opening Frame**
- **Visuals:** Wide shot of a simple, well-lit stage with a neutral background to focus on the puppet’s movements.
- **Lighting:** Bright and even to ensure all actions are clearly visible.
- **Audio:** Energetic instrumental music fades in.

**Script Line:**
*(Voiceover or Puppet)*: “Let me show you what I can do!”

---

### **Demonstration of Movements**
- **Action:**
  1. Puppet raises both arms above its head and waves energetically.
  2. Performs a smooth head tilt, blinking to emphasize articulation.
  3. Steps forward with a confident stride, alternating arm swings naturally.

**Script Line:**
*(Puppet)*: “Pretty smooth, huh? But wait, there’s more!”

---

### **Complex Actions**
- **Action:**
  1. Puppet spins around gracefully, extending one arm outward.
  2. Squats slightly, mimicking a playful jump.
  3. Ends with a small bow, gesturing dramatically with both hands.

**Script Line:**
*(Puppet)*: “Ta-da! What do you think?”

---

### **Closing Frame**
- **Visuals:**
  - Camera zooms in on the puppet’s face as it winks and smiles.
  - Background lighting dims slightly to spotlight the puppet.
- **Audio:** Music crescendos and fades out.

**Script Line:**
*(Puppet)*: “I’m just getting started!”

---

## **3. Technical Notes**
1. **Camera Angles:**
   - Start with a wide shot for full-body movements.
   - Use medium shots for gestures and close-ups for facial expressions.
2. **Timing:**
   - Scene duration: Approximately 15 seconds.
   - Synchronize movements with music cues for added impact.
3. **Audio Sync:**
   - Balance music volume with dialogue to ensure clarity.
   - Match lip-sync precisely with dialogue delivery.
