## Change Records for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 2025-06-12

#### Change Details:
- **Change ID/Name**: CR-001: Controller Development Timeline Revision
- **Description of Change**: Adjusted the estimated duration for the "Controller Development" phase to better reflect solo development constraints. Extended timeline from 3 weeks to over 4 months.
- **Affected Project Areas**: Project schedule, milestone deadlines, critical path sequencing.

#### Reason and Impact:
- **Reason for Change**: 
  - Original schedule underestimated time needed for PCB design, firmware development, and debugging by a solo developer.
- **Impact Assessment**: 
  - Extended project duration, shifted downstream dependencies (Puppet Integration, Sync Testing).
  - Reduces time pressure and improves likelihood of robust controller performance.
- **Required Adjustments**: 
  - Update Gantt chart timelines, revise milestone expectations, and re-sequence task dependencies in Obsidian vault.

### 2025-06-14

#### Change Details:
- **Change ID/Name**: CR-002: Microcontroller Evaluation Expanded
- **Description of Change**: Added Teensy 4.1 and RP2040 to the evaluation list for microcontroller selection, in addition to ESP32.
- **Affected Project Areas**: Component selection, firmware architecture, budget estimates.

#### Reason and Impact:
- **Reason for Change**: 
  - Feedback from robotics forum suggested better PWM handling and library support from alternative controllers.
- **Impact Assessment**: 
  - Potential increase in BOM cost, additional time for benchmarking and compatibility testing.
- **Required Adjustments**: 
  - Extend task CD-T02, allow for firmware abstraction layer to accommodate MCU flexibility.

### 2025-06-15

#### Change Details:
- **Change ID/Name**: CR-003: Added Technical Documentation Integration
- **Description of Change**: Integration of technical documentation process using Obsidian + MkDocs as the primary toolchain.
- **Affected Project Areas**: Documentation pipeline, deliverables, tooling setup.

#### Reason and Impact:
- **Reason for Change**: 
  - Needed consistent, version-controlled, markdown-based documentation with internal linking.
- **Impact Assessment**: 
  - Added setup and learning time, improved maintainability and internal navigation of technical notes.
- **Required Adjustments**: 
  - Add a documentation prep task, assign storage folders, update task CD-T14.
