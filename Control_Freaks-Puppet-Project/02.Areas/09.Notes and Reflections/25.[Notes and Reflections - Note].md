## Notes and Reflections for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 2025-06-15

#### Key Insights

- **Insight 1**:
  - **Observation**: Realized that testing firmware in isolation using mock sensor inputs helps avoid repeated full-system rebuilds.
  - **Impact**: Significantly reduced debugging time; narrowed issues down to firmware logic instead of hardware assumptions.
  - **Future Application**: Integrate a mock test rig into all future hardware/firmware development phases.

- **Insight 2**:
  - **Observation**: Attempting to maintain concurrent task lists across physical notebooks and digital notes caused version mismatches.
  - **Impact**: Confusion over latest task status; duplicated work in some areas.
  - **Future Application**: Commit to centralizing all task tracking in Obsidian vault only, using Kanban and Dataview logs.

#### Reflections on Project Progress

- **Reflection 1**:
  - **Topic**: Controller PCB Design
  - **Reflection**: While the schematic and layout were finished early, I underestimated time needed for physical assembly and validation.
  - **Improvement Areas**: Allocate more buffer time between schematic completion and validation.

- **Reflection 2**:
  - **Topic**: Documentation Discipline
  - **Reflection**: Documentation lagged behind during crunch periods, making backlogs harder to reconstruct.
  - **Improvement Areas**: Enforce end-of-day note logging rule, even brief summaries.

---

#### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge 1**:
  - **Description**: Servo jitter under load due to unstable PWM signal.
  - **Solution Implemented**: Adjusted timer prescaler settings in firmware and implemented signal smoothing.
  - **Outcome**: Servo signal stabilized; future codebase updated with default smoothing routine.

- **Challenge 2**:
  - **Description**: Overscoping puppet control system features (e.g., facial expression control via second MCU).
  - **Solution Implemented**: Deferred advanced control features to Phase 2.
  - **Outcome**: Kept current build achievable and testable with fewer dependencies.

---

#### Team Dynamics and Performance

- **Team Reflection**:
  - **Observation**: As a solo developer, daily self-scrum check-ins helped maintain motivation and structure.
  - **Strengths**: Self-discipline, clear task organization.
  - **Areas for Improvement**: Risk of tunnel vision without external review. Schedule periodic peer review checkpoints with mentors.

---

#### Stakeholder Feedback

- **Feedback 1**:
  - **Source**: UFV Makerspace Mentor
  - **Feedback Summary**: Recommended including an emergency shutdown routine in firmware and designing a quick-swap mechanism for servo units.
  - **Actions Taken**: Added shutdown routine to MCU interrupt handler; redesign for quick-swap underway in Rev B.

- **Feedback 2**:
  - **Source**: Class peer review (Automation Lab)
  - **Feedback Summary**: Noted that the puppet head CAD lacks ventilation for internal electronics.
  - **Actions Taken**: Modified model to include louvered vents behind jaw panel.

---

#### Lessons Learned

- **Lesson 1**:
  - **Description**: Working solo demands rigorous version control‚Äîeven on hardware and documentation.
  - **Application**: Implement Git commit policy for schematic and firmware changes with detailed messages.

- **Lesson 2**:
  - **Description**: Early decisions (e.g., connector orientation) have ripple effects on test jig complexity.
  - **Application**: Use more detailed design reviews before ordering any physical parts.

---

#### Looking Forward

- **Next Steps**:
  - **Upcoming Focus**: Finalize firmware logic for audio-synced puppet gestures; begin puppet frame fabrication.
  - **Preparation Required**: Reserve 3D printer slots, order linkage materials, and finalize gesture library.

- **Long-Term Considerations**:
  - **Strategic Insight**: System modularity will enable future puppet character swaps without rewiring the full setup.
  - **Future Planning**: Incorporate hot-swappable modules for each major limb or actuator group in future puppets.
