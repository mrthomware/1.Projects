# Project Notes and Reflections for Control Freaks Puppet Project

## Notes

### Meeting Summaries

- **Date and Attendees**: 2025-05-30 | Thomas Ware (solo)
- **Key Points and Decisions**:
  - Decided to begin controller development before puppet fabrication.
  - Task tracking will be done via Obsidian Kanban plugin and YAML-annotated logs.
- **Action Items and Responsibilities**:
  - Create PCB schematic and layout (Thomas)
  - Begin weekly reflections and status logging.

---

### Task Updates

- **Task Name**: CD-T01 ‚Äì Schematic Design
- **Progress and Changes**: Completed schematic using EasyEDA, integrated low-noise op-amp input stage.
- **Updated Deadlines and Resources**: Completed 5 days early; no additional resources used.

---

### Stakeholder Communications

- **Date and Stakeholder**: 2025-06-01 | Makerspace Mentor (UFV)
- **Summary of Interaction**: Shared initial design progress and integration plan for servo sync.
- **Feedback and Suggestions**: Add manual test mode to firmware for easier servo validation.

---

### Risk Logs

- **New Risks or Changes**: ADC noise causing feedback loop instability.
- **Risk Mitigation Effectiveness**: Added low-pass filtering; partially resolved. Further tuning needed.

---

### Change Records

- **Change Details**: Shifted mechanical build phase to follow controller firmware testing.
- **Reason and Impact**: Needed finalized control board to validate servo positions. Resulted in 2-week schedule shift.

---

### Budget Tracking

- **Current Expenditures**: $78.44 CAD on PCBs, $29.99 CAD on servo harness materials.
- **Discrepancies and Adjustments**: None to date. Within projected budget.

---

### Resource Usage

- **Resource Details**: 3D printer access (3hrs/day limit), breadboard test setup, oscilloscope loan.
- **Utilization Notes**: Efficient use of shared tools; logged hours per tool used for future forecasting.

---

### Technical Notes (for technical projects)

- **Technical Details**:
  - Microcontroller: ATmega328P
  - PWM Outputs: 3 channels used for servo signals
  - ADC Input: Analog position sensor (¬±5V input scaled to 0‚Äì5V)
- **Documentation for Reference**:
  - `firmware/main.c`
  - `PCB/ServoController_RevA.pdf`
  - `vault/Control_Freaks_Vault/Resources/Specs/`

---

### Lessons Learned

- **Insights and Best Practices**:
  - Modularizing firmware early helps in isolating bugs quickly.
  - Avoid concurrent design/testing steps when working solo‚Äîstrict sequencing improves quality and reduces stress.

---

## Reflections

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenges Faced**:
  - Overload from simultaneous school assignments and project deadlines.
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Reprioritized weekly work blocks; used Obsidian Daily Notes to track burn rate and redirect focus.

---

### Team Performance

- **Team Dynamics**:
  - Solo project‚Äîrelied heavily on structured note-taking and scheduled task reviews.
- **Areas of Strength and Improvement**:
  - Strength: Persistent execution and follow-through.
  - Improvement: Need for better timeboxing of documentation tasks.

---

### Project Milestones

- **Milestone Review**:
  - CD-T01 through CD-T03 complete.
  - PD-T01 in planning.
- **Successes and Improvements**:
  - Completed schematic ahead of schedule; board was functional on first print.

---

### Personal Development

- **Growth and Learning**:
  - Improved in analog signal design, circuit debugging, and scheduling.
- **Skills and Knowledge Development**:
  - Gained confidence with EasyEDA, firmware modularization, and solo sprint planning.

---

### Stakeholder Satisfaction

- **Feedback Review**:
  - Makerspace mentors appreciated clean documentation and servo synchronization approach.
- **Management of Expectations**:
  - Weekly vault updates ensure transparent progress tracking.

---

### Efficiency and Effectiveness

- **Analysis of Project Processes**:
  - Kanban + YAML structure made it easy to see blockages.
  - Firmware testing lagged due to lack of test bench until Week 3.

---

### Adaptation to Change

- **Responses to Changes/Events**:
  - Extended firmware block to allow for stability testing; shifted puppet build to follow.
  - Maintained timeline integrity by compressing CAD model tasks using pre-existing templates.

---

### Post-Project Review

- **Overall Success and Challenges**:
  - Strong execution of controller development phase.
  - Time compression caused documentation quality dips mid-phase.
- **Future Learnings**:
  - Never skip mockup testing. Even quick physical checks catch layout oversights.

---

### Actionable Improvements

- **Improvements for Future Projects**:
  - Implement an ‚Äúauto-log‚Äù system in Obsidian that timestamps completed steps.
  - Use checklist-style templates to track material usage per phase.

---

### Knowledge Sharing

- **Sharing with Team and Stakeholders**:
  - Vault is structured using PARA; each project phase has annotated logs and daily notes.
  - Planning to do a Control Freaks breakdown video to document process for other makers.
