## Technical Notes ‚Äì Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Technical Details

- **Controller Board Design (Rev A)**:
  - Custom PCB designed in KiCad with 6 PWM outputs (servo-ready), UART debug port, and onboard 5V LDO regulator.
  - ATmega328P used as MCU in early prototype; planned upgrade to STM32 series for more timers and speed.
  - Board dimensions: 60mm √ó 70mm, with M3 mounting holes.
  - Power rails separated for logic and servo lines; bulk caps added near servo headers for stability.

- **Firmware Development**:
  - Timer1 and Timer2 configured for precise PWM generation.
  - Serial communication implemented for debugging servo positions via a Python serial monitor.
  - EEPROM used to store preset servo positions and animation keyframes.

- **Servo Testing Rig**:
  - Test jig built from 3D printed PLA frame and reused puppet limb segments.
  - Servos mounted using M2 screws and vibration dampeners to mimic in-puppet operation.

- **Motion Sync Planning**:
  - External audio input will be analyzed using FFT to drive amplitude-based servo expressions.
  - Planned integration of microSD module for preloaded motion sequences triggered via buttons or GPIO events.

- **Prototyping Challenges**:
  - Power draw from multiple servos caused brown-out resets on the ATmega under load‚Äîaddressed with larger 2200ŒºF caps.
  - Solder mask clearance issues identified on Rev A PCB‚Äîwill revise trace-to-pad distances in Rev B.
