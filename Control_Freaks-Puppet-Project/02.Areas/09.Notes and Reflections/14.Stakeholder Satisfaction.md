## Stakeholder Satisfaction for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Feedback Review

- **Collection of Feedback**:
  - Feedback was gathered through YouTube community comments, Discord discussions, and peer feedback sessions during lab demonstrations.
  - Informal polls were also posted on social channels to gauge interest in technical vs. behind-the-scenes content.

- **Summary of Feedback**:
  - Positive feedback centered around the creativity and uniqueness of the project.
  - Viewers appreciated the raw prototyping footage and early servo demos.
  - Concerns were raised about long development timelines and lack of update frequency.
  - Peers emphasized the need for better system modularity and accessible documentation.

- **Analysis of Feedback**:
  - Stakeholders want more visibility into project milestones and timelines.
  - There is strong interest in technical documentation and open-source accessibility.
  - Common themes include faster iteration cycles, better communication of goals, and community engagement.

### Management of Expectations

- **Understanding Stakeholder Expectations**:
  - General audience expects entertainment and storytelling progress.
  - Engineering peers expect detailed technical updates and system transparency.
  - Academic collaborators expect measured progress and documentation for critique.

- **Alignment of Expectations with Project Goals**:
  - Internal milestones are aligned with technical progress, but not always with external communications.
  - The audience expects more regular updates than the current publishing pace supports.

- **Proactive Communication**:
  - Weekly visual updates (sketches, CAD, servo test videos) will be released to meet external expectations.
  - A GitHub README update strategy is planned to reflect real-time firmware/PCB state.

- **Response to Feedback**:
  - Clear roadmap and milestone visualization (via Mermaid Gantt) has been shared.
  - Lab partner feedback on PCB redesign has already led to a trace optimization cycle.

### Continuous Improvement

- **Implementation of Changes**:
  - Public Trello board or Kanban-style Obsidian dashboard under construction for progress tracking.
  - Devlog shorts will be embedded in YouTube channel‚Äôs project playlist.

- **Measurement of Improvement Efforts**:
  - Stakeholder satisfaction will be reassessed after launch of the first full puppet prototype.
  - Engagement metrics (likes, comments, link clicks) will be tracked to gauge interest.

### Documentation and Reporting

- **Recording of Feedback and Actions**:
  - All stakeholder interactions are logged in the `Stakeholder Communications.md` file.
  - Actions taken from feedback are cross-referenced in the task tracker (`Tasks - Note.md`).
