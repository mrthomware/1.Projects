## Risk Log for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### 2025-06-15

#### New Risks or Changes:

- **Risk R-001: Solo Developer Constraint**
  - **Description**: Risk of project delay due to all development tasks being handled by a single individual.
  - **Severity Level**: High
  - **Likelihood**: High
  - **Impact**: Could delay multiple phases, especially Controller Development and Puppet Integration.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Re-sequencing all tasks to be strictly sequential; adding generous buffer time between major milestones.

- **Risk R-002: Hardware Integration Uncertainty**
  - **Description**: Uncertainty in interfacing selected microcontroller with servo driver ICs and sensors.
  - **Severity Level**: Medium
  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Could cause delays or rework during PCB prototyping.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Breadboard testing all subsystems before PCB routing; sourcing known-compatible components.

- **Risk R-003: Audio Synchronization Failure**
  - **Description**: Animatronic audio-visual sync may fail due to timing issues or code inefficiencies.
  - **Severity Level**: Medium
  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Poor visual performance; may require firmware redesign.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: Start audio-sync tests early using mocked servo movements; implement frame-accurate timestamps.

#### Risk Mitigation Effectiveness:

- **Risk R-001**
  - **Mitigation Actions Taken**: Rebuilt the Gantt chart using solo-task sequencing; extended timeline from 3 months to ~9 months.
  - **Effectiveness Assessment**: High ‚Äî reduces unrealistic workload; improves focus and prevents bottlenecks.
  - **Further Actions Required**: Build weekly review checkpoint system to identify early signs of overwork or task slippage.

- **Risk R-002**
  - **Mitigation Actions Taken**: Created breadboard test plan (CD-T05); ordered backup parts with similar specs.
  - **Effectiveness Assessment**: Moderate ‚Äî still dependent on testing success and driver libraries.
  - **Further Actions Required**: Test each subsystem in isolation before integration; prepare alternate routing options.

- **Risk R-003**
  - **Mitigation Actions Taken**: Added servo-sync firmware test task (CD-T11); scheduled test bench audio debugging.
  - **Effectiveness Assessment**: TBD ‚Äî will depend on initial sync results.
  - **Further Actions Required**: Profile MCU timing with debug output; plan servo motion interpolation logic.
