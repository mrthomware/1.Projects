## Adaptation to Change in Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Responses to Changes/Events

- **Identification of Changes/Events**:
  - Delayed parts procurement due to supplier backorder on specialized servo headers.
  - Extended design iteration period for the puppet head geometry based on evolving animation and mechanical constraints.
  - Mid-development realization that controller firmware would need audio-sync capability rather than simple pre-recorded motion playback.

- **Initial Response**:
  - Immediately re-prioritized tasks dependent on backordered components and began parallel development on software-side tasks (CD-T08, CD-T09).
  - Froze the external puppet silhouette after second design revision to allow physical prototype and servo slot mapping to begin.
  - Created a firmware sub-task list and spun off a micro project to explore audio signal processing logic.

- **Analysis of Impact**:
  - Timeline adjustments were made to push physical puppet assembly later in the schedule, allowing time for firmware testing.
  - Some puppet detail modeling tasks (PD-T03, PD-T04) were re-sequenced to begin after mechanical layout was locked.
  - Firmware workload was increased, requiring more buffer allocation in controller development timeline.

- **Adaptation Strategies**:
  - Adopted a Kanban-style task board in Obsidian with daily check-in reflection notes.
  - Integrated firmware development and puppet animation timing planning earlier than originally scheduled.
  - Shifted 3D model revision checkpoints into their own isolated tasks, allowing for better focus on completion pacing.

- **Communication and Stakeholder Engagement**:
  - Regularly documented task reassignments and daily progress through PARA-aligned reflection logs.
  - Visual timeline updates using Mermaid Gantt charts to monitor new sequences and identify potential overflows.

- **Effectiveness of Response**:
  - Successfully avoided idle time during parts delay by preemptively tackling dependent software tasks.
  - New layout revisions improved sync capabilities between hardware and performance expectations.
  - Minor setback in mechanical armature testing due to delayed print queue for new bracket mounts.

- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Hardware delays can be productively mitigated with early stage modular planning and flexible milestone buffering.
  - Design iteration loops must have defined freeze points to prevent bottlenecking downstream phases.
  - Firmware development benefits from real hardware abstraction planning before actual hardware exists.

- **Future Preparedness**:
  - Develop a standard "Delay Protocol" SOP document to pre-plan alternative tasks when blockers emerge.
  - Include contingency variants in Gantt planning with optional paths for hardware vs. software-first execution.
  - Add a feedback mechanism that locks visual assets for mechanical translation at specified checkpoints.

### Continuous Monitoring and Flexibility

- **Regular Review of Project Environment**:
  - Weekly PARA dashboard reviews with status snapshots and reflection summaries.
  - Review project sync rhythm with allocated flex time every 10-day cycle.

- **Flexible Project Framework**:
  - Adopted sequential task structure with staggered buffer logic built into controller and puppet pipelines.
  - Regular insertion of reevaluation markers for assumptions and scope boundaries at midpoints in each major phase.
