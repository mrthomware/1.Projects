## Post-Project Review for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Overall Success and Challenges

- **Achievement of Objectives**:
  - The project successfully produced a functional, servo-controlled animatronic puppet, documented in detail through Obsidian. Educational content and CAD files were developed alongside firmware. Most original objectives were achieved, though timeline adjustments were necessary due to solo development constraints.

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Scope**: Met original project scope (hardware, firmware, documentation, creative pipeline).
  - **Timeline**: Delayed by 4 weeks overall due to PCB revisions and servo control debugging.
  - **Budget**: Kept under target due to efficient reuse of materials and prototype iterations.
  - **Quality**: High fidelity mechanical assembly and modular firmware achieved.
  - **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: High‚Äîpositive reactions from early audience feedback and internal review.

- **Key Challenges**:
  - Design delays caused by analog signal interference.
  - PCB debugging required full re-routing due to pin conflict.
  - Time constraints from academic workload and solo resource limitation.

### Future Learnings

- **Lessons Learned**:
  - Incorporating project reflections weekly helped catch and address drift early.
  - Buffer time is *essential* in hardware cycles‚Äînever underestimate debugging durations.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use of YAML metadata in every Obsidian doc streamlined search, query, and overview pages.
  - Linear Gantt planning for solo workflow eliminated confusion and improved focus.

- **Improvement Areas**:
  - Stakeholder communication could benefit from a standing feedback schedule.
  - Documentation of versioned designs needs consistent version naming throughout.

- **Recommendations for Future Projects**:
  - Add one-week buffer after every major hardware milestone.
  - Begin wiring diagrams and PCB layout in parallel to schematic development.
  - Record video documentation *during* building stages‚Äînot just after.

---

### Stakeholder Feedback

- **Stakeholder Reflections**:
  - Control Freaks early reviewers praised the clarity of the educational content and visual progression from sketch to movement.
  - Makerspace mentors suggested improved layout printing techniques and better ESD safety in workbench setup.

- **Stakeholder Recommendations**:
  - Introduce checkpoints for mechanical safety testing.
  - Develop simplified ‚Äúdemo mode‚Äù for presentations and outreach.

---

### Team Performance and Development

- **Team Assessment**:
  - As a solo developer, strong self-discipline and task scheduling were critical. Time tracking showed most productive hours were early morning.
  
- **Individual Growth**:
  - Grew significantly in embedded firmware development, analog electronics troubleshooting, and storytelling integration.
  - Learned new tools such as EasyEDA, TunerStudio, and automated task scripting in Obsidian.

---

### Documentation and Archiving

- **Project Documentation**:
  - All project notes, designs, firmware, and reflections are archived in the Obsidian Vault and GitHub project repo.

- **Project Closure**:
  - Final Gantt review, Vault backup, and final Kanban board snapshot completed and archived on June 15, 2025.

---

### Conclusion

- **Final Thoughts**:
  - The Control Freaks Puppet Project demonstrated the integration of engineering, storytelling, and workflow discipline in a solo-maker context. The vault system built alongside the puppet will serve as the foundation for the next series of puppet experiments and YouTube content, empowering a more professional future production process.
