### **Task Card: Define Technical Specifications**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Document the technical specifications for the **3D Puppet Design** project. This will ensure clarity on design requirements, functionality, and production feasibility.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Outline Core Specifications**
    
    - **Dimensions:**
        - Overall size (e.g., height, width, depth).
        - Proportions (e.g., head-to-body ratio).
    - **Articulation Points:**
        - Number of movable joints (e.g., neck, arms, fingers).
        - Range of motion for each joint.
2. **Material Requirements**
    
    - Identify materials for:
        - **3D model textures** (e.g., fur, plastic, metal).
        - **Physical prototype** (e.g., resin, fabric, rubber).
3. **Design Considerations**
    
    - **Weight:** Ensure the design is lightweight for ease of handling or animating.
    - **Durability:** Specify structural integrity for repetitive movements or wear.
    - **Aesthetic Details:** Focus on textures, color schemes, and accessory integration.
4. **Software and Compatibility**
    
    - List software for modeling, rigging, and animation (e.g., Blender, Maya).
    - Ensure the design is compatible with output formats for:
        - 3D printing (`.stl`, `.obj`).
        - Animation engines (`.fbx`, `.blend`).
5. **Functional Requirements**
    
    - Define:
        - Rigging needs (e.g., bone structure, IK/FK setup).
        - Animation compatibility (e.g., lip-syncing, gestures).
    - Include specifications for:
        - **Digital Puppets:** Optimized poly count for rendering.
        - **Physical Puppets:** Mechanisms for smooth articulation.
6. **Power and Controls (Optional)**
    
    - For animatronics or advanced prototypes:
        - Specify control systems (e.g., servos, remote controls).
        - Define power sources (e.g., battery-operated or wired).
7. **Document Approval Criteria**
    
    - Include benchmarks for sign-off (e.g., articulation precision, material durability).

---

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Add sketches, diagrams, or material samples if applicable.
- Include a table summarizing dimensions, materials, and key features.

---

#### **Priority:**

High – This task establishes the foundation for design, development, and production.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** when specifications documentation begins.
- **Review Column:** Submit the document for stakeholder review and approval.
- **Done Column:** Mark as completed once specifications are approved and finalized.
