# **3D Design Standards**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Overview**
This document defines the standards for 3D design in the **3D Puppet Design** project. These guidelines ensure visual consistency, functionality, and technical compatibility across all assets.

---

## **2. Design Criteria**

### **A. Geometry**
1. **Topology:**
   - Use quads for clean and efficient topology.
   - Avoid triangles and n-gons, especially in deformable areas.
2. **Edge Flow:**
   - Ensure edge loops follow natural contours to support animation and rigging.
3. **Poly Count:**
   - Maintain an optimized poly count for real-time rendering and animation.

### **B. Proportions and Scale**
1. **Reference Models:**
   - Align proportions with approved design sketches and references.
2. **Scaling Consistency:**
   - Use consistent units across all assets (e.g., meters in Blender).
   - Ensure compatibility with rigging and animation workflows.

### **C. UV Mapping**
1. **UV Layout:**
   - Create clean and distortion-free UV maps.
   - Use logical spacing and avoid overlapping UV islands unless intentional.
2. **Texture Resolution:**
   - Use high-resolution textures (e.g., 4K) for detailed areas.
   - Optimize texture sizes for secondary elements to reduce file size.

### **D. Materials and Textures**
1. **Shader Use:**
   - Assign physically-based materials (PBR) for realistic rendering.
   - Ensure material properties like roughness and metallic values are accurate.
2. **Consistency:**
   - Maintain a cohesive style across all assets.
   - Match materials to the "Mad Scientist" theme.

### **E. Functional Design**
1. **Articulation Points:**
   - Design joints to support natural movement and avoid deformation issues.
2. **Prototype Readiness:**
   - Ensure assets can transition smoothly into 3D printing or physical prototyping.
3. **Rigging Compatibility:**
   - Design assets with rigging requirements in mind, such as joint placement and deformation areas.

## **3. Review and Approval Process**

### **A. Pre-Review Checklist**
1. Confirm topology meets animation requirements.
2. Verify UV maps are clean and textures are applied correctly.
3. Test material settings in both viewport and render environments.

### **B. Feedback Integration**
1. Document feedback from design and animation leads.
2. Implement changes iteratively to align with project standards.

### **C. Final Approval**
1. Present finalized models for stakeholder approval.
2. Ensure all feedback has been addressed before proceeding to rigging or texturing.

## **4. Best Practices**
1. **Iterate Regularly:**
   - Conduct reviews at each stage of the modeling process.
2. **Document Changes:**
   - Maintain records of all iterations and updates.
3. **Test Early:**
   - Validate designs in their intended environments to identify issues early.

---

## **5. Notes and Observations**
- Adherence to these standards minimizes rework and ensures asset consistency.
- Collaboration between design, animation, and prototyping teams is essential for seamless workflows.
