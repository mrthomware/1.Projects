## **3. Operational Guidelines**

### **A. Pre-Printing**
1. **Setup and Calibration:**
   - Ensure the printer is placed on a stable surface.
   - Calibrate the print bed for even leveling.
   - Check filament feed and load the correct filament type.
2. **File Preparation:**
   - Slice the 3D model using compatible software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
   - Verify print settings: layer height, infill, supports, and nozzle temperature.
3. **Environment Check:**
   - Ensure the area is well-ventilated.
   - Keep flammable materials away from the printer.

### **B. During Printing**
1. **Monitoring:**
   - Observe the initial layers to ensure proper adhesion.
   - Check for issues like warping, stringing, or under-extrusion.
2. **Safety:**
   - Avoid touching the heated bed or nozzle during operation.
   - Do not leave the printer unattended for extended periods.

### **C. Post-Printing**
1. **Removing Prints:**
   - Wait for the print bed to cool before removing the object.
   - Use a scraper tool gently to avoid damaging the bed surface.
2. **Cleaning:**
   - Clean the nozzle and bed to remove residue.
   - Store unused filament in a sealed, moisture-free container.

## **4. Maintenance Schedule**

| **Task**                        | **Frequency**   | **Notes**                               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Clean nozzle and print bed      | After every print | Improves adhesion and reduces clogs.    |
| Check and tighten belts         | Weekly          | Ensures precision in movement.          |
| Recalibrate bed leveling        | Weekly          | Prevents print failures and uneven layers. |
| Lubricate moving parts          | Monthly         | Reduces wear and noise.                 |
| Update firmware                 | Monthly         | Ensures compatibility and new features.  |

## **5. Troubleshooting**

| **Issue**                       | **Possible Cause**                   | **Solution**                                      |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Warping                         | Print bed not leveled or insufficient adhesion | Level the bed and apply adhesive if needed.     |
| Stringing                       | Nozzle temperature too high          | Lower the nozzle temperature slightly.           |
| Under-extrusion                 | Clogged nozzle or filament feed issue| Clean the nozzle and check filament path.        |
| Layer shifting                  | Loose belts or unstable surface      | Tighten belts and ensure the printer is stable.  |
