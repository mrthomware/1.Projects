## **2. Material List and Safety Information**

### **A. Filaments**
1. **PLA (Polylactic Acid):**
   - **Properties:** Biodegradable, low toxicity.
   - **Handling:**
     - Use in a well-ventilated area.
     - Avoid exposure to temperatures above 200Â°C without equipment.
   - **Storage:** Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
   - **Disposal:** Recycle if possible or dispose of in accordance with local regulations.
2. **ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene):**
   - **Properties:** Durable, high-temperature resistance.
   - **Handling:**
     - Ensure proper ventilation to avoid inhalation of fumes.
     - Use gloves to handle hot materials.
   - **Storage:** Keep in a sealed container to prevent moisture absorption.
   - **Disposal:** Dispose of as non-hazardous waste unless otherwise specified.

### **B. Adhesives and Solvents**
1. **Super Glue (Cyanoacrylate):**
   - **Hazards:** Can bond skin instantly; irritant to eyes and respiratory tract.
   - **Precautions:**
     - Use in a well-ventilated area.
     - Wear gloves and safety goggles.
   - **First Aid:**
     - Skin contact: Soak in warm, soapy water and peel off carefully.
     - Eye contact: Rinse with water and seek medical attention immediately.

2. **Isopropyl Alcohol (99%):**
   - **Hazards:** Flammable; can cause skin and eye irritation.
   - **Precautions:**
     - Keep away from heat sources and open flames.
     - Use gloves and avoid prolonged skin contact.
   - **First Aid:**
     - Skin contact: Rinse thoroughly with water.
     - Eye contact: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes.

### **C. Paints and Coatings**
1. **Acrylic Paints:**
   - **Hazards:** Minimal; non-toxic when dry.
   - **Precautions:**
     - Use in a ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.
     - Avoid ingestion and prolonged skin contact.
   - **Disposal:** Allow to dry completely before discarding as non-hazardous waste.

2. **Spray Paints:**
   - **Hazards:** Highly flammable; can cause respiratory irritation.
   - **Precautions:**
     - Use outdoors or in a well-ventilated spray booth.
     - Wear a respirator and safety goggles.
   - **Disposal:** Follow local hazardous waste disposal guidelines.
