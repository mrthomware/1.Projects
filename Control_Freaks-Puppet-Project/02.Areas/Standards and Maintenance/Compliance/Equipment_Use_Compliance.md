## **4. Specific Guidelines by Equipment**

### **A. 3D Printers**
1. **Before Use:**
   - Ensure the printer bed is leveled and free of debris.
   - Verify filament type and load correctly.
2. **During Use:**
   - Monitor print progress periodically to avoid failures.
   - Do not leave printers unattended during critical tasks.
3. **After Use:**
   - Power off the printer and allow components to cool.
   - Remove and store unused filament properly.

### **B. Laser Cutters**
1. **Before Use:**
   - Verify material compatibility to prevent toxic fumes.
   - Check ventilation systems for proper operation.
2. **During Use:**
   - Never leave the laser cutter unattended while in operation.
   - Wear safety goggles and keep a fire extinguisher nearby.
3. **After Use:**
   - Clean the cutting bed and lenses.
   - Log the materials used and results in the equipment log.

### **C. Workstations and Rendering Systems**
1. **Software Updates:**
   - Keep all software up to date to prevent compatibility issues.
   - Use licensed versions of all tools.
2. **Hardware Use:**
   - Avoid overloading systems during rendering tasks.
   - Ensure adequate cooling and avoid overheating components.

### **D. Prototyping Tools**
1. **Tool Maintenance:**
   - Inspect tools before and after use for damage or wear.
   - Sharpen or replace tools as needed to maintain performance.
2. **Safety Measures:**
   - Always use protective gear when operating prototyping tools.
   - Follow manufacturer guidelines for safe operation.
