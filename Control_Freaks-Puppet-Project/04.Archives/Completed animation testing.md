### **Task Card: Completed Animation Testing**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Test the rigged 3D puppet model to ensure proper animation functionality. This includes validating joint movement, articulation points, and overall compatibility with animation tools.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Prepare Rigged Model**
    
    - Ensure the puppet model is fully rigged with bones, joints, and control handles.
    - Verify that the rigging meets the project’s animation requirements.
2. **Set Up Animation Scenarios**
    
    - Define test animations for key actions:
        - Basic movements: Head turns, arm raises, leg bends, etc.
        - Complex actions: Talking, walking, or waving.
        - Extreme poses: Full range of motion tests for each joint.
3. **Run Animation Tests**
    
    - Import the model into animation software (e.g., Blender, Maya, or Unreal Engine).
    - Apply predefined animations or create new ones for testing.
    - Check for:
        - Smooth transitions between movements.
        - Absence of mesh distortion or clipping.
        - Proper alignment of textures during movement.
4. **Document Issues**
    
    - Log any problems encountered (e.g., joint stiffness, deformations).
    - Record animations that showcase problematic areas for reference.
5. **Fix and Retest**
    
    - Collaborate with the rigging and modeling teams to resolve issues.
    - Retest animations to confirm fixes are successful.
6. **Stakeholder Review**
    
    - Share test animations with stakeholders for feedback.
    - Gather input to refine animations and functionality.
7. **Finalize Testing**
    
    - Approve the rigged and tested model for use in production or prototyping.
    - Export finalized animations if required (e.g., `.fbx` for game engines, `.mp4` for presentations).

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Include video files of animation tests.
- Attach notes on identified issues, resolutions, and stakeholder feedback.

---

#### **Priority:**

High – This task ensures the puppet functions correctly in animation contexts.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** during testing.
- **Review Column:** Gather feedback on animation functionality and address issues.
- **Done Column:** Mark as completed once animations pass all tests and are approved.
