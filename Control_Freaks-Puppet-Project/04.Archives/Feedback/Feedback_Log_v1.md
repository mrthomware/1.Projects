## **2. Feedback Entries**

### **Concept Development Phase**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                                   | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder A       | Preferred "Mad Scientist" theme with exaggerated features and a quirky outfit.               | Incorporate into refined sketches.              | In Progress       |
| [Insert Date]  | Team Member B       | Mood boards need more diversity in material references for both digital and physical designs. | Add references for metallic and transparent parts. | Completed         |
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder C       | Ensure puppet proportions allow for realistic articulation.                                   | Adjust sketches to include proportional joints. | Pending Review    |

### **3D Modeling Phase**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                                   | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder A       | Texture samples should align with educational use-case; avoid overly complex patterns.       | Simplify texture details for visibility.        | Pending           |
| [Insert Date]  | Team Member C       | Adjust head-to-body ratio to improve visual appeal.                                           | Modify proportions in base model.              | In Progress       |

### **Rigging and Animation Phase**
| **Date**       | **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                                   | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Animator X          | Ensure smooth articulation at shoulder and knee joints.                                      | Test and refine rigging in these areas.         | Not Started       |
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder B       | Animation must support full lip-sync capabilities.                                           | Develop rig controls for mouth articulation.    | In Progress       |

## **3. Summary of Actions**

### **Top Priorities**
1. Finalize sketches and mood boards with stakeholder-preferred themes.
2. Refine 3D model proportions and textures to align with feedback.
3. Develop a rigging system that supports smooth movement and expressive animation.

### **Key Resolutions**
- Improved material diversity in mood boards (Completed).
- Adjusted visual style to emphasize quirky and whimsical design elements (Ongoing).

---

## **4. Notes and Observations**
- Stakeholder alignment remains strong, with consistent emphasis on usability and aesthetic appeal.
- Feedback implementation is on schedule, with minor delays due to detailed modeling revisions.
- Regular reviews are helping to minimize scope creep.
