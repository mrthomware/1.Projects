### **Task Card: Finalized 3D Puppet Model**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Finalize the 3D puppet model by refining details, textures, and features. Ensure the model is ready for rigging, animation, or prototyping, depending on project requirements.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Detail Sculpting**
    
    - Add fine details like facial features, textures (e.g., fur, fabric, metal), and intricate elements.
    - Ensure articulation points (e.g., joints, hinges) are well-defined.
2. **Apply Textures and Materials**
    
    - Use tools like Substance Painter, Blender, or Maya to add textures and shaders.
    - Match textures to the puppet’s intended style (e.g., soft fabric for whimsical, metallic for technical).
3. **Lighting and Rendering (Optional)**
    
    - Set up basic lighting to preview how the puppet will look in its final environment.
    - Render a few high-quality images for stakeholder review.
4. **Perform Functionality Tests**
    
    - Test articulation by rotating joints and checking range of motion.
    - Ensure the model meets rigging requirements (if animated).
5. **Stakeholder Review**
    
    - Present the detailed model to stakeholders for approval.
    - Incorporate feedback into the final version.
6. **Prepare Files for Delivery**
    
    - Export the model in appropriate formats (e.g., `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.blend`).
    - Save the file in a clear directory structure:
        - **Finalized Model:** High-poly and low-poly versions.
        - **Textures:** Organized by material and resolution.
        - **Supporting Files:** Notes, reference images, and iteration history.

---

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Attach finalized render images for quick previews.
- Provide documentation on model specifications and software used.

---

#### **Priority:**

Critical – This task marks the completion of the 3D design phase.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** when detailing begins.
- **Review Column:** Gather stakeholder feedback on the detailed model.
- **Done Column:** Once the model is approved and exported, mark the task as completed.
