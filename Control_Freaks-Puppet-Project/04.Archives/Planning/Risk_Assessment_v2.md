## **2. Risk Categories and Analysis**

### **A. Project Management Risks**
| **Risk**                          | **Likelihood** | **Impact**   | **Mitigation Strategy**                     |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Delayed stakeholder feedback      | High           | High         | Schedule regular review checkpoints; set clear deadlines for responses. |
| Scope creep due to additional requests | Medium      | High         | Clearly define and document project scope; obtain stakeholder sign-offs for changes. |
| Team member availability issues   | Low            | Medium       | Identify backup resources and cross-train team members. |

### **B. Technical Risks**
| **Risk**                          | **Likelihood** | **Impact**   | **Mitigation Strategy**                     |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Software compatibility issues     | Medium         | Medium       | Test software and tools before project start; ensure all team members use the same versions. |
| Technical challenges in rigging   | Medium         | High         | Allocate additional time for testing and troubleshooting rig issues. |
| Material defects in prototyping   | Low            | Medium       | Source high-quality materials from reliable suppliers; conduct small-scale testing. |

### **C. External Risks**
| **Risk**                          | **Likelihood** | **Impact**   | **Mitigation Strategy**                     |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Vendor delays for prototype materials | Medium     | High         | Order materials well in advance; maintain a buffer stock if feasible. |
| Unforeseen regulatory or compliance issues | Low    | Medium       | Research regulations beforehand; consult experts as needed. |

## **4. High-Priority Risks and Actions**
### **1. Delayed Stakeholder Feedback**
- **Action Plan:**
  - Schedule recurring meetings with stakeholders.
  - Use collaboration tools to track feedback deadlines.
  - Escalate delays to project sponsors if necessary.

### **2. Technical Challenges in Rigging**
- **Action Plan:**
  - Allocate time for iterative testing and refinement.
  - Use advanced rigging tools like Mayaâ€™s Auto-Rig system.
  - Consult with rigging specialists if issues persist.

### **3. Vendor Delays for Materials**
- **Action Plan:**
  - Place orders early in the project timeline.
  - Build relationships with multiple vendors to ensure redundancy.
  - Maintain detailed records of vendor communications.
