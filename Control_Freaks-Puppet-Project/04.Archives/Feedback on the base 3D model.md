### **Task Card: Feedback on the Base 3D Model**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Present the base 3D puppet model to stakeholders or the design team for feedback. Use the input to identify areas for improvement and finalize the model for detailing, rigging, and texturing.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Prepare the Base Model for Review**
    
    - Ensure the model is complete with:
        - Defined proportions and articulation points.
        - Clean topology and symmetry.
    - Export the model in a shareable format (e.g., `.obj`, `.blend`, `.fbx`) or render images from multiple angles.
2. **Schedule Feedback Session**
    
    - Invite stakeholders or team members for a review session.
    - Share the base model or renders in advance for preliminary feedback.
3. **Facilitate Feedback Discussion**
    
    - Present the model, highlighting:
        - Key features and articulation points.
        - Any challenges or limitations encountered during modeling.
    - Encourage feedback on:
        - Proportions and overall design.
        - Functionality of joints and articulation points.
        - Alignment with project goals (e.g., animation-ready, visually appealing).
4. **Document Feedback**
    
    - Record stakeholder comments and categorize them as:
        - **Critical Changes:** Essential adjustments needed for functionality or design.
        - **Optional Enhancements:** Suggestions for minor improvements or additional details.
5. **Iterate on the Model**
    
    - Refine the model based on feedback:
        - Adjust proportions, features, or topology as needed.
        - Verify that changes align with the feedback and project objectives.
6. **Finalize for Next Steps**
    
    - Share the updated model for final approval.
    - Prepare the approved model for the detailing phase.

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Include rendered images or videos of the base model.
- Attach a feedback summary highlighting comments and decisions.

---

#### **Priority:**

High – Stakeholder feedback ensures the base model is ready for detailing and further development.

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** when feedback gathering begins.
- **Review Column:** Collect and address feedback on the base model.
- **Done Column:** Mark as completed once the base model is finalized and approved.
