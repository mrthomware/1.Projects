#### **Subtasks**

1. **Define Themes**
    
    - Select 2–3 themes to guide the design:
        - **Whimsical & Playful:** Bright, colorful, and expressive.
        - **Mad Scientist:** Quirky, eccentric, and tech-savvy.
        - **Educational & Functional:** Clean, transparent mechanisms with clear labeling.
2. **Gather Visual References**
    
    - Search for images of:
        - Existing puppets (e.g., Muppets, animatronic characters).
        - Accessories and outfits (e.g., goggles, lab coats, props).
        - Textures and materials (e.g., fur, plastic, resin).
        - Color palettes fitting each theme.
3. **Organize by Categories**
    
    - Divide mood boards into sections:
        - **Character Style:** Overall look and personality.
        - **Features:** Articulation, eyes, and mouth design.
        - **Accessories:** Props, outfits, and details.
        - **Materials and Colors:** Textures, tones, and patterns.
4. **Design the Boards**
    
    - Use tools like Canva, Adobe Spark, or Pinterest to compile references into visually cohesive boards.
    - Label sections clearly for easy interpretation.
5. **Review and Iterate**
    
    - Share the boards with the team or stakeholders for feedback.
    - Refine based on input, ensuring alignment with project goals.
