# Integration with Project Tools

- **Integration Methods**: Strategies for embedding and linking project references into tool-based workflows.

---
Integrating reference materials into project management tools enhances accessibility and workflow cohesion for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**. This ensures that essential technical documents, design references, and communication records are directly available within the tools used daily by the development team.

## Integration of Reference Materials with Project Tools for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Selection of Project Management Tools

- **Primary Tools Used**:
  - **Obsidian**: Core reference and knowledge management platform.
  - **GitHub Projects**: Task tracking and issue logging.
  - **Google Drive**: Shared file repository for PDFs, CAD files, and media assets.
  - **Notion (Experimental)**: Used selectively for presentation boards and sharing documentation with external stakeholders.

---

### Methods of Integration

- **Direct Linking in Obsidian**:
  - Use `[[Wiki Links]]` to reference files within the vault.
  - Embed Google Drive and GitHub URLs directly in markdown for quick access.

- **GitHub Attachment References**:
  - Link code-related documents to issues or PRs via markdown checklists or comments, e.g., firmware version notes linked to `servo-firmware-v1.1` branch issues.

- **Google Drive Embeds**:
  - Shareable Drive links for schematics, datasheets, budget spreadsheets.
  - Permissions set via viewer/editor roles depending on internal/external use.

- **Task Attachment in GitHub Projects**:
  - Use `.md` comment fields to attach YAML blocks or Obsidian export summaries for each GitHub task card.

---

### Synchronization and Real-Time Updates

- **Bi-Directional Linking System**:
  - Every task in GitHub or Gantt board in Obsidian contains backward reference to supporting documentation.

- **Update Notifications**:
  - Project Discord channel auto-posts update messages when documents are updated using a webhook.

---

### Accessibility and Permissions

- **Vault Access Control**:
  - Obsidian vault permissions managed locally; shared copies exported with `.pdf` suffix for distribution.
  
- **Google Drive**:
  - Restricted sharing by group email for MakerSpace collaborators only.
  - Redacted versions of schematics available publicly when required.

- **GitHub Private Repos**:
  - Access limited to trusted collaborators with 2FA enforced.

---

### Search Functionality

- **Vault Search Tags**:
  - YAML headers include searchable tags: `tags: [reference, datasheet, controller, puppet-mechanics]`.

- **GitHub Issues & Labels**:
  - Tag project references in issues using labels like `reference-material`, `linked-resource`, `design-doc`.

---

### Training and Support

- **Obsidian Usage Guide**:
  - Vault onboarding document created: `[[Resources/Guides/Using_Control_Freaks_Vault.md]]`.

- **Team Walkthroughs**:
  - Regular project syncs include training on new integrations or reference updates.

- **Support Channel**:
  - Dedicated thread in Discord workspace for vault/PM tool questions.

---

### Regular Reviews and Updates

- **Quarterly Integration Reviews**:
  - Checklist-driven review of all tool integrations and link health (e.g., broken Google Drive or GitHub URLs).

- **Tool Improvement Log**:
  - Vault page logs any modifications to integration methods: `[[Resources/References/Tool_Integration_Log.md]]`.

Integrating reference materials into the Control Freaks Puppet Project tools ecosystem improves accessibility, reduces redundancy, and ensures every stakeholder has access to the latest, actionable information. Seamless access to specs, diagrams, and documentation is critical for maintaining project momentum and reducing miscommunication.
