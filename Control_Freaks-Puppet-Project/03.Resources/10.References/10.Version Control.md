# Version Control

- **Versioning System**: Methods used for maintaining version control.

---
Effective version control is crucial in managing project documents for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, ensuring that everyone works with the most current information and historical versions are preserved for traceability, audits, and process integrity. Below is the structured system used in this project:

---

## Version Control System for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Version Control Methods

- **Document Versioning Convention**:
  - Format: `filename_vX.Y.md` where `X` is the major version (milestone or phase shift) and `Y` is the minor revision (corrections or improvements).
  - Status labels such as `DRAFT`, `REVIEWED`, and `FINAL` are added in the YAML header and file metadata.
  - Example: `Servo_Controller_Schematic_v1.2.md` with `status: "REVIEWED"` in YAML.

- **Version History Tracking**:
  - Git is used as the core version control system.
  - Every document in the Obsidian Vault is tracked in a private GitHub repository, with commit messages noting document changes and rationale.

---

### Centralized Document Management

- **Central Repository**:
  - All project documentation is stored in `/Control_Freaks-Puppet-Project/Resources/` and tracked via Git.
  - Snapshots of the vault are backed up weekly and synced with the remote repo.

- **Access and Editing Control**:
  - Local editing is restricted to the lead developer (Thomas Ware).
  - Any edits by collaborators must be made through pull requests reviewed before merging.

---

### Regular Updates

- **Update Routine**:
  - Documents are reviewed on the 1st and 15th of each month for accuracy.
  - Milestone completions trigger a mandatory documentation update checkpoint.

- **Notification System**:
  - Project Kanban board (`Notes and Reflections`) includes checkboxes for "Updated Version Published" next to key docs.
  - Change summaries are logged in `[[Change Records]]`.

---

### Archiving Old Versions

- **Archiving Policy**:
  - Old versions are moved to `/Resources/Archives/` after 2 major revisions or 6 months (whichever comes first).
  - Archived files are renamed with `_archived_YYYY-MM-DD` suffix.

- **Retrieval Process**:
  - Indexed in `[[Reference Archive Index.md]]` with links and hash tags.
  - Retrieval can be performed via Git history or vault search.

---

### Training and Documentation

- **Training for Team Members**:
  - The `[[Training/VersionControl_Guide.md]]` provides onboarding material for contributors.
  - Walkthrough includes Git basics, commit conventions, and Obsidian-specific workflows.

- **Documentation of Version Control Procedures**:
  - Located at `[[Standard Operating Procedures/Document_Versioning_Policy.md]]`.
  - Includes flowcharts for document approval and merge process.

---

### Integration with Project Tools

- **Tool Integration**:
  - GitHub repository linked with the Obsidian vault via VS Code Git integration.
  - Mermaid diagrams track document version histories in milestone reports.

---

### Auditing and Compliance

- **Regular Audits**:
  - Monthly review checks version control compliance using the checklist in `[[Audit/VersionControl_AuditLog.md]]`.
  - Past non-compliant issues and resolutions are documented for transparency.

---

Implementing and maintaining this structured version control system ensures that the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** maintains document integrity, enables traceable development, and reduces risks of using outdated or conflicting information. It directly supports auditing, training, and agile documentation management.
