# Organized Documentation

- **Filing System**: Description of the organization and filing system.

---
Having an organized documentation system is crucial for efficient information management in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**. This structure ensures that every file, resource, and note is accessible, secure, and logically grouped within the PARA framework and Obsidian vault ecosystem.

## Organized Documentation for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Filing System Overview

- **System Structure**:
  - A **PARA-based hierarchy** is used:
    - `Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/`
    - `Areas/Control Systems/`
    - `Resources/References/`
    - `Archives/Legacy Notes/`
  - All documentation is nested within this structure, with clear phase tags like `Controller Development`, `Puppet Development`, `Show Pipeline`, and `Vault Integration`.

- **Categorization**:
  - Each document is categorized using:
    - **Project Phase** (e.g., CD = Controller Development)
    - **Document Type** (e.g., Reference, Report, Log, Diagram)
    - **Scope** (e.g., Electrical, Mechanical, Narrative)
    - Tagged with YAML headers to enable Dataview queries in Obsidian.

---

### Document Naming Conventions

- **Standardized Naming**:
  - Format: `CFPP_<PhaseCode>-<DocType>-<ShortTitle>_YYYYMMDD_vX.md`
  - Example: `CFPP_CD-Ref-PID_Controller_20250615_v1.md`
  - YAML includes metadata like `title`, `project`, `document_type`, `tags`, and `status`.

---

### Storage and Retrieval

- **Storage Locations**:
  - **Digital Only**: All files stored in the Obsidian Vault under:
    - `Control_Freaks-Vault/`
    - GitHub repo for versioned code and markdown exports.
    - Google Drive used for large binary assets (3D models, videos).

- **Retrieval Process**:
  - Use Obsidian's search and Dataview plugin to filter by tags, creation date, or custom properties like `phase`, `linked_tasks`, `version`.

---

### Security and Access

- **Access Control**:
  - Local vault access controlled via OS-level permissions.
  - Shared vault exports use redacted/public versions when distributed.

- **Confidentiality Protocols**:
  - Secure notes (e.g., budget, internal IP) are encrypted in `.gpg` or `.7z` formats in a restricted `Vault_Private/` subdirectory.

---

### Version Control

- **Version Management**:
  - File versioning is manual and follows the naming convention.
  - GitHub repository provides full commit history and rollback capability.
  - Obsidian version history enabled via community plugin.

---

### Regular Maintenance

- **Update and Cleanup Routine**:
  - Weekly tag audits using a ‚ÄúStale Document‚Äù Dataview.
  - Quarterly archival of deprecated notes to `Archives/`.
  - Duplicate notes flagged with YAML `status: "duplicate"` tag.

---

### Integration with Communication Tools

- **Link with Communication Channels**:
  - Each project task on GitHub links back to Obsidian note using canonical markdown URLs.
  - Team communications (Discord, Email) reference note IDs and filenames for traceability.

---

### Documentation Best Practices

- **Best Practice Guidelines**:
  - All markdown files must include:
    - Complete YAML block
    - Section headers (`##`) for clarity
    - Inline comments or `[!note]` blocks for clarity
  - Diagrams are embedded via `![[filename.png]]` with captions.
  - One file per logical topic, kept under 500 lines if possible.

---

This structured documentation system for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** ensures that every team member‚Äîwhether reviewing legacy servo test results or uploading new puppet rig blueprints‚Äîcan do so confidently, with traceability, clarity, and consistency across all tools.
