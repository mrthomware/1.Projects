# Accessibility

- **Access Provision**: How team members can access reference materials.

---
Ensuring easy and secure access to reference materials is essential for the smooth functioning of the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**. This document outlines the structured accessibility approach designed to balance open collaboration with tight security controls.

## Accessibility of Reference Materials for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Access Channels

- **Digital Repository Access**:
  - All project documentation and references are stored within the `Control_Freaks-Vault` Obsidian Vault.
  - Primary repository: Local folder synced with GitHub (for version control) and Google Drive (for large assets like 3D models or audio files).
  - Structured under the PARA system: `Projects/`, `Areas/`, `Resources/`, `Archives/`.

- **Physical Document Access**:
  - Physical sketches, notebooks, and hardware manuals are stored in a secure project binder located at the Control Freaks prototype desk.
  - Physical-to-digital scans are uploaded weekly to the `Resources/References/Scanned Docs` subfolder.

---

### User Access Levels

- **Defined Access Permissions**:
  - **Thomas Ware (Project Owner)**: Full access to all reference materials, configuration, and version control.
  - **Collaborators**: Read/write access to relevant vault sections based on current phase (e.g., CD, PD).
  - **External Viewers** (optional): Access to redacted/exported versions for mentorship or partner viewing.

- **Access Control System**:
  - GitHub repo permissions set via SSH keys and collaborator roles.
  - Google Drive shares are role-based (Viewer, Commenter, Editor) and reviewed monthly.
  - Obsidian vault backups are encrypted and stored on an external hard drive.

---

### Remote Access

- **VPN and Remote Access Tools**:
  - Remote access is provided via Syncthing for Obsidian vault syncing across devices.
  - GitHub and Drive are accessible through password-protected accounts and 2FA.

- **Guidelines for Remote Access**:
  - Do not access sensitive files over unsecured public networks.
  - Always sync changes before shutting down Obsidian on remote devices.
  - Vault auto-locks on idle after 5 minutes when used via mobile.

---

### Mobile Accessibility

- **Mobile Access Solutions**:
  - The Obsidian Mobile app (Android/iOS) syncs with the primary vault using GitHub + GitJournal or Obsidian Sync (if enabled).
  - Google Drive app grants access to scanned PDFs, technical manuals, and schematics.
  - Voice notes can be recorded on mobile and uploaded to `Resources/Audio Notes`.

---

### Training and Support

- **User Training**:
  - A Quick Start Guide (`README.md`) is included in the vault root.
  - Onboarding tasks include familiarization with vault structure and YAML tagging.
  - Video walkthroughs are stored in `Resources/Training/Vault-Orientation/`.

- **Support Channels**:
  - For vault issues: Contact Thomas via Discord or GitHub Issues.
  - For Google Drive access: Contact project Google admin via linked Gmail.

---

### Regular Updates and Notifications

- **Update Alerts**:
  - GitHub commits generate webhook pings to Discord project channel.
  - Vault changelog (`Vault_ChangeLog.md`) lists weekly updates and refactors.
  - Important reference updates flagged using the `#updated` tag in YAML.

---

### Security Measures

- **Data Security Protocols**:
  - All sensitive documents stored under `Vault_Private/` are compressed and encrypted (`*.7z`, `*.gpg`).
  - GitHub repo excludes private folders via `.gitignore`.
  - Google Drive 2FA enforced for all linked devices.
  - Regular audit of file permissions conducted on the first Sunday of each month.

---

This comprehensive approach ensures that all reference materials within the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** are accessible to authorized team members across devices and locations‚Äîwithout compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of project-critical data.
