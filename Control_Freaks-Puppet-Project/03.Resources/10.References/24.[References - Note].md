# References - Note

**Note:** Regular maintenance and updating of this reference management system are essential to support informed decision-making and enhance the project's credibility and reliability.

This includes:

- **Ongoing Validation**: All reference entries must be periodically reviewed for relevance and accuracy, especially after project milestones or major updates.
- **Version Tracking**: Ensure version control is in place for all documents and references, with logs detailing updates and access history.
- **Centralized Oversight**: A designated project lead should maintain and audit this system, ensuring no critical documents are missing, misfiled, or out-of-date.
- **Backup & Redundancy**: References should be stored redundantly across secure, versioned cloud and local archives.
- **Final Documentation Closure**: Upon project completion, the full reference system is to be reviewed, locked, and archived in accordance with the procedures defined in the Archiving Process.

By adhering to these practices, the Control Freaks Puppet Project maintains a high standard of transparency, accountability, and knowledge preservation.
