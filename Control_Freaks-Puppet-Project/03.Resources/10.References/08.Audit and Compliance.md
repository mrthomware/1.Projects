## Audit and Compliance Readiness for Reference Materials in Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Audit Preparation

- **Audit Scope Identification**  
  - Scope may include financial oversight on prototyping expenses, documentation of IP ownership, and safety compliance during hardware testing.
  
- **Relevant Documents Compilation**  
  - Includes:
    - Contracts and NDAs
    - Budget tracking sheets and grant documents
    - Lab safety checklists and ESD compliance logs
    - Intellectual property declarations
    - Technical change logs and firmware audit trails

### Organizational Compliance

- **Compliance Standards Review**  
  - Review all reference materials against:
    - CSA Z432-16 (safety)
    - Canadian Copyright Act
    - IP ownership declarations
    - Grant usage terms from educational institutions or sponsors

- **Documenting Compliance Measures**  
  - All compliance actions are logged in:
    - `[[Compliance/Lab_Safety_Checklist_June2025.md]]`
    - `[[Compliance/CFPP_IP_Declaration_v1.md]]`
    - `[[Legal/Character_Copyright_Statement.pdf]]`

### Version Control and Document Integrity

- **Version Tracking**  
  - All living documents are version-controlled using Git in the Obsidian vault or synced cloud folders (e.g., `/Compliance/`).

- **Document Change Logs**  
  - Maintained in YAML headers and `CHANGELOG.md` for firmware specs and financial entries.

### Accessibility and Organization

- **Easy Access to Documents**  
  - All documents are stored under:
    - `/Resources/References/`
    - `/Compliance/`
    - `/Legal/`
    - Indexed in a central `Reference_Index.md` file.

- **Secure and Restricted Access**  
  - Documents stored on encrypted drives and shared via access-controlled GDrive folders. Obsidian vault is Git-managed for audit trail.

### Training and Awareness

- **Audit Procedures Training**  
  - Training checklist to be distributed at project midpoint covering:
    - Document retrieval
    - Compliance vocabulary
    - Presentation of records

- **Awareness of Compliance Requirements**  
  - Team briefings embedded as recurring tasks in the Task Register for controller and puppet development phases.

### Regular Reviews and Updates

- **Pre-Audit Reviews**  
  - Quarterly reviews logged in `[[Audit/Pre-Review_June2025.md]]`.

- **Continuous Update Process**  
  - Change control protocol defined in `[[Change_Records/Control_Protocol_v1.md]]`.

### Documentation of Compliance and Audits

- **Audit Reports and Findings**  
  - Stored in `/Audit/` with naming: `AuditReport_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

- **Action Taken Record**  
  - Action plans logged under each audit report and cross-referenced in task index (e.g., `[[CD-T12]]`, `[[PD-T07]]`).

### Risk Management

- **Identifying Audit-Related Risks**  
  - Risks logged in `[[Risk Logs/Audit_Compliance_Risks.md]]` and monitored biweekly.
