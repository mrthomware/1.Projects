# Archiving

- **Archiving Process**: Method for archiving materials post-project.

---
Effective archiving of materials after the completion of the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** ensures proper historical preservation, knowledge transfer, and compliance with retention policies. The following is the structured archiving process tailored to this project‚Äôs scope and tools.

---

## Archiving Process for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Defining What to Archive

- **Selection Criteria**:
  - The following materials are to be archived:
    - Final technical schematics (PCB layouts, firmware versions)
    - Puppet fabrication guides and 3D models
    - Final versions of scripts and show pipeline documents
    - Budget reports and grant records
    - Key correspondence with collaborators
    - Meeting minutes, milestone reports, and stakeholder feedback
    - Post-project retrospective documents

---

### Archiving Methods

- **Digital Archiving**:
  - All digital documents are stored in:
    - `/Archives/Project_Complete/`
    - Synced with a read-only Google Drive backup
    - Vault GitHub repository is frozen at final commit and tagged as `final-release-v1.0`

- **Physical Archiving**:
  - Fabrication notebooks and paper schematics stored in labeled binders at the workshop archive cabinet
  - USB backup of all final digital files secured in a fireproof safe

---

### Organizing Archived Materials

- **Categorization and Indexing**:
  - Files are grouped by:
    - Project Phase (Controller, Puppet, Show, Vault Integration)
    - Document Type (Technical, Financial, Administrative)
  - Indexed in `Archive_Index.md` located at `/Archives/`

- **Metadata and Tagging**:
  - All markdown documents include the following YAML tags:
    - `archived: true`
    - `date_archived: YYYY-MM-DD`
    - `archived_by: Thomas Ware`

---

### Accessibility and Retrieval

- **Access Policies**:
  - Archived materials are read-only by default
  - Only Vault Maintainer and Project Manager may reclassify or restore files

- **Retrieval Process**:
  - Files retrieved using:
    - Search tags in Obsidian (`tag:#archived`)
    - `Archive_Index.md` for manual lookup
    - Obsidian dataview query for archived files

---

### Security and Confidentiality

- **Data Protection**:
  - Digital documents encrypted using AES-256 if containing sensitive hardware IP
  - GitHub repo access locked post-archive
  - Google Drive backup permissions restricted to project leads

- **Compliance with Legal Requirements**:
  - Financial documents retained for 7 years
  - Personal data (e.g., from surveys) anonymized or deleted based on university research guidelines

---

### Duration of Archiving

- **Retention Periods**:
  - Project documentation: 10 years
  - Technical references: Indefinite (for reuse)
  - Financial reports: 7 years
  - Stakeholder communications: 3 years

---

### Digital Preservation

- **Preservation Strategies**:
  - Quarterly checksum verification for integrity
  - File format migration plan:
    - `.psd` ‚Üí `.png` or `.svg`
    - `.blend` ‚Üí latest Blender LTS
    - `.md` ‚Üí portable HTML/PDF snapshots

---

### Documentation of Archiving Process

- **Archiving Procedure Manual**:
  - Stored in `Resources/Documentation/Archiving_Manual.md`
  - Includes versioning policies, indexing instructions, and metadata tagging guide

---

### Periodic Review

- **Review Schedule**:
  - Archive contents reviewed every 2 years
  - Logs reviewed during end-of-year wrap-up meetings

---

### Disposal of Unnecessary Materials

- **Secure Disposal Protocols**:
  - Files marked for deletion listed in `Archive_Delete_Log.md`
  - Digital files shredded using secure deletion tools (e.g., `srm`)
  - Paper records destroyed using cross-cut shredders after approval

---

This structured and secure archiving process ensures that the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** maintains historical traceability, protects sensitive content, and facilitates future project referencing.
