# Managing References

### Organized Documentation

- **Filing System**:  
  The reference materials for the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* are categorized using the PARA framework within the Obsidian Vault. Each type of reference (e.g., technical manuals, stakeholder communications, legal agreements) is stored under `/Resources/References/`, with standardized filenames and version suffixes (e.g., `_v1`, `_final`, `_archived`). Folders are sorted by relevance to project phases and document type.

### Accessibility

- **Access Provision**:  
  All team members access the references through a shared drive synchronized with Obsidian. Read/write permissions are managed through the local file system for solo development and via version-controlled GitHub repositories (private) for collaborative inputs and documentation. Password-protected PDFs and shared Google Docs are used for sensitive reference materials when external stakeholder input is involved.

### Version Control

- **Versioning System**:  
  Reference documents use semantic versioning in filenames (e.g., `CF-Charter_v2.1.md`). Git is used to track changes and provide rollback capabilities. Key documents also include version metadata in YAML headers to ensure alignment across documents and tools.

### Citation and Attribution

- **Citation Guidelines**:  
  External sources are cited using APA style within markdown notes and documents. Internal references use Obsidian wiki-links. A dedicated page `[[Reference Index]]` tracks and categorizes all references and their origin, including attribution to team members or external publications.

### Confidentiality and Security

- **Confidentiality Measures**:  
  All sensitive documents (e.g., grant paperwork, team contracts) are encrypted using VeraCrypt or stored in a secure folder with password protection. Only authorized contributors (the solo developer or supervisor) can decrypt these resources. GitHub repo is set to private with SSH key authentication only.

### Regular Review and Update

- **Update Schedule**:  
  Reference materials are reviewed at the end of each major milestone or once per month during active development phases. The schedule is tracked under the task `[[CD-T05: Maintain Reference System]]`. Each review logs date, changes made, and any retirements or archive notes.

### Integration with Project Tools

- **Integration Methods**:  
  References are linked directly inside task templates and milestone documents using Obsidian internal links. Additionally, Notion-style embeds in project dashboards allow quick access from Kanban and timeline views. Selected documents are synced to mobile via Obsidian Sync for quick access during on-site development.

### Training and Orientation

- **Training Plan**:  
  A README and onboarding note `[[Reference Access Guide]]` explains the structure, version control conventions, and security protocols. For new collaborators (future expansion), a 30-minute walkthrough and checklist will be added to the onboarding plan.

### Audit and Compliance

- **Audit Readiness**:  
  Reference logs and version history ensure all materials are audit-ready. For student funding and grant reporting, records are grouped under `/Archives/Funding Reports/2025/` with clear audit trails. All files used in submissions are duplicated into a `/Compliance Submission` folder at time of submission.

### Archiving

- **Archiving Process**:  
  Upon project closure, all reference materials are moved into `/Archives/References/[Year]/` and compressed into `.zip` bundles named by project phase. Archived documents receive an `archived: true` field in YAML headers and are flagged in the `Reference Index` for legacy use.

Implementing this structured reference management system for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** ensures traceability, accessibility, and compliance throughout the project lifecycle. Regular reviews, version control, and clearly defined access protocols help maintain information integrity and organizational transparency.
