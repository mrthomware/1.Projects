## Citation and Attribution Guidelines for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Importance of Citation

- **Purpose of Citations**:
  - Acknowledge the intellectual property of external sources and collaborators.
  - Support technical decisions with credible references.
  - Avoid plagiarism and establish transparent research practices in documentation, scripts, firmware notes, and design guides.

---

### Citation Styles

- **Preferred Citation Style**:
  - The project uses **APA 7th Edition** format for all written documents, including research summaries, technical reports, and Obsidian notes.
  - Reference formatting should follow:  
    `Author, A. A. (Year). Title of work. Publisher. DOI/URL`

- **Style Adaptation**:
  - In informal internal documents (e.g., meeting notes, Vault notes), brief inline links with author + year are acceptable:
    > *e.g., inspired by Johnson‚Äôs servo design (Johnson, 2022)*

---

### Documenting Sources

- **Types of Sources to Cite**:
  - Journal articles and textbooks
  - Whitepapers and industry standards
  - Blog posts, YouTube videos, or forums used for design inspiration
  - GitHub repositories, open-source tools, and firmware libraries
  - Interview notes or external consultations

- **Recording Source Information**:
  - A `[[Reference Log]]` note is maintained for tracking all research citations during the project lifecycle.
  - Fields include: Author, Title, Link, Date Accessed, Application in Project.

---

### In-Text Citations

- **Format**:
  - In Obsidian and Markdown:
    > *(Smith, 2023)* or *(IEEE 802.15.4, 2020)*
  - In formal documents:
    > Smith (2023) suggests...

- **Direct Quotes and Paraphrasing**:
  - Direct quotes should be enclosed in quotation marks and include page numbers where applicable.
  - Paraphrased material should still reference the original source.

---

### Reference Lists or Bibliographies

- **Creating Reference Lists**:
  - End-of-document bibliographies should be titled **References** and follow APA 7 format.
  - Markdown lists should use the following example:
    ```
    - Smith, J. (2023). *Introduction to Servo Robotics*. TechPress.
    - IEEE. (2020). *IEEE Standard for Low-Rate Wireless Networks*. IEEE 802.15.4.
    ```

- **Organization**:
  - References should be ordered alphabetically by author‚Äôs last name.

### Citation Tools and Software

- **Recommended Tools**:
  - **Zotero**: For automatic citation storage and export.
  - **Obsidian Zotero Plugin**: For quick citation injection into notes.
  - **Mendeley or EndNote** (for users with academic access).
