## Material Resources Management for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### üß∞ Materials List

- **Physical Materials**:
  - Servo motors (MG996R, DS3218)
  - Linkage rods, brackets, and pushrods
  - Plastics for body structure (PLA, PETG)
  - Wires, breadboards, resistors, capacitors, screw terminals
  - Hot glue, epoxy, Loctite, 3M fasteners

- **Equipment**:
  - Soldering station
  - Digital calipers
  - Oscilloscope (MakerSpace access)
  - 3D printers (Ender 3 Pro, Prusa Mini)
  - CNC router (for future base rigging plate)

- **Technology Resources**:
  - KiCad (PCB Design)
  - Obsidian (Documentation Vault)
  - GitHub (Version Control)
  - Fusion 360 (CAD)
  - TIA Portal (PLC Sim Testing ‚Äì long term)

- **Resource Sources**:
  - Local: UFV MakerSpace stock, Vancouver‚Äôs Lee‚Äôs Electronics
  - Online: Digi-Key, AliExpress (servo arms), Amazon (adhesives, breadboards)
  - Backups: Hardware loan pool, electronics parts bin in lab drawer E

### üìÜ Usage Plan

#### Resource Allocation and Scheduling
- **Phase 1 ‚Äì Controller Development**:
  - Focus: PCB components, protoboards, soldering supplies
  - Equipment: Soldering station, multimeter, oscilloscope (shared)
- **Phase 2 ‚Äì Puppet Development**:
  - Focus: Plastics, servos, glue, 3D printer filament
  - Equipment: 3D printers, cutting tools, adhesives
- **Phase 3 ‚Äì Show Pipeline Development**:
  - Focus: Electronics rig assembly, cabling, debugging
- **Phase 4 ‚Äì Vault Integration**:
  - Focus: Digital tools (Obsidian, GitHub, PDF annotation tools)

#### Efficiency and Waste Reduction
- **Optimal Use**:
  - Shared components reused across multiple mockups (e.g., servo horns)
  - Minimize supports in 3D prints using angled designs
  - Snap-fit designs to reduce adhesive waste

- **Maintenance Schedule**:
  - Weekly nozzle cleaning for 3D printers
  - Bi-weekly soldering iron tip cleaning
  - Monthly oscilloscope and power supply check (MakerSpace)

### üìä Monitoring and Adjustment

- **Usage Tracking**:
  - Inventory table stored in: `03.Resources/Material Inventory.md`
  - Obsidian Dataview auto-pulls usage logs from Weekly Review notes
  - Consumables tallied at end-of-week review

- **Adjustment Strategy**:
  - Reorder triggers set based on low stock indicators
  - Backup options reviewed during weekly planning

- **Safety and Compliance**:
  - Compliance with MakerSpace safety rules (PPE, check-in, MSDS)
  - Hot glue gun and soldering use only in ventilated zone
  - Fire extinguisher within 2 meters during hot tool use

- **Environmental Considerations**:
  - PLA scraps collected in recycling bin
  - Failed prints logged and reviewed for design adjustment
  - E-waste stored for proper campus disposal

---

### üì¶ Procurement and Storage

#### Procurement Process
- **Ordering Procedures**:
  - Part request sheet completed in Weekly Review Template
  - Supplier contacted via UFV purchasing or student personal card
  - Track shipping time and estimate arrival for each resource

- **Lead Times and Buffer Stock**:
  - Critical electronics (servos, header pins): 2-week lead time
  - 3D filament: Maintain 500g buffer
  - Adhesives: Maintain 2-tube buffer

#### Storage and Handling
- **Storage Facilities**:
  - Project bin #CFV01 in lab drawer
  - Electronics stored in anti-static boxes
  - Filament stored in dry box with silica

- **Handling Guidelines**:
  - Heavy items lifted by base, not connectors
  - Sensitive parts handled with ESD precautions
  - Label all tools/materials after usage for traceability
