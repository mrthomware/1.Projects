## üìã Resource Management for Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

## üë§ Human Resources

- **Team Members**:  
  - Thomas Ware (Solo Developer) ‚Äì responsible for all phases of the project including controller design, fabrication, animation, and documentation.  
  - AI Co-Pilot (ChatGPT) ‚Äì used for structured planning, script generation, code suggestions, and task breakdowns.

- **Task Allocation**:
  - Tasks are strictly sequential due to solo development.
  - Each phase is documented using PARA folders and tracked via Obsidian Kanban.

- **Skills and Training**:
  - Skills Required: PCB design, embedded firmware, 3D modeling, servo tuning, Obsidian knowledge systems, storytelling for YouTube.
  - Self-training during the **Controller Development** phase via datasheets, tutorials, and testing logs.

---

## üí∏ Financial Resources

- **Budget Overview**:
  - Total Estimated Budget: **$500 - $750 CAD**
  - Funding Sources: Personal savings, part-time work, and in-kind support from MakerLab resources.

- **Cost Tracking**:
  - Maintained in `/02.Areas/How to Setup the Project Guidlines/07.Resources and Documents/Project Budget.md`
  - Categories: PCB production, electronics (servos, headers), puppet materials, 3D printing, unexpected iterations

---

## üß± Material Resources

- **Materials List**:
  - Electronics: Microcontroller, capacitors, MOSFETs, connectors
  - Mechanical: PLA filament, servo motors, puppet hardware
  - Equipment: 3D printer, soldering tools, oscilloscopes (shared access)

- **Usage Plan**:
  - Component acquisition sequenced per Gantt dependencies
  - Bench testing before assembly to ensure reuse of parts where applicable

---

## üìö Information Resources

- **Data Sources**:
  - Microcontroller Datasheets (ESP32, ATmega)
  - Obsidian Vault Templates (Dataview, Kanban Plugin)
  - Design standards from open-source animatronic puppetry guides
  - Control Freaks MOCs, structured knowledge from `/03.Resources/`

- **Access Plan**:
  - All references, code snippets, and logs centralized in Obsidian
  - Templates standardized for reuse in future puppet builds

---

## ‚è≥ Time Management

- **Timeline**:
  - Sequential schedule enforced (no concurrency)
  - Timeline structured around 4 major phases:
    1. **Controller Development**
    2. **Puppet Development**
    3. **Show Pipeline Development**
    4. **Obsidian Vault Integration**
  - Duration and task breakdowns stored in `Gantt Chart.md`

- **Progress Monitoring**:
  - Tracked via Obsidian Kanban plugin (`kanban-plugin: board`)
  - Weekly reviews tied to milestones and buffer checks

---

This **Resource Management Plan** for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** provides a structured, practical roadmap for managing all critical assets‚Äîhuman, financial, material, informational, and temporal‚Äîunder the constraints of a solo developer workflow. It is actively updated as the project evolves to ensure optimal allocation and adaptability.
