# 💵 Budget Documents

- **Financial Details**: Breakdown of costs, funding, financial reports.

---
Budget documents are a critical foundation for the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, ensuring the financial feasibility of every milestone across all four development phases. They establish visibility over all costs, funding sources, and cost-control mechanisms to keep the solo-run project within its tight budget.

### 📈 Cost Management

#### 📐 Cost Estimation

- Cost estimates are based on:
  - Vendor pricing (e.g., LCSC, DigiKey, Amazon)
  - Historical averages from similar school or hobby projects
  - BOM analysis for electronics
  - CAD material consumption estimates for 3D print filament and resin

#### 🧮 Cost Control Strategies

- Split purchases by milestone
- Use free or educational licenses where possible
- Repurpose parts (e.g., wires, test servos) when safe
- Use Kanban reviews to gate unnecessary purchases
