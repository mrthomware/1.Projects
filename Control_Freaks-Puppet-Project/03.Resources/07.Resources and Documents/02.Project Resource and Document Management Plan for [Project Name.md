# 📦 Project Resource and Document Management Plan for Control Freaks Puppet Project

This plan outlines how resources and documentation will be managed throughout the lifecycle of the *Control Freaks Puppet Project*. Proper resource allocation and document control ensure successful execution, transparency, and alignment with project goals.

---

## 🔧 Resource Management

### 👥 Human Resources

- **Team Members**: Thomas Ware (solo developer) with functional responsibilities in mechanical design, electronics, programming, and content creation.
- **Task Allocation**: Tasks assigned based on phased structure—controller development, puppet design, animation syncing, and integration with Obsidian Vault workflows.
- **Skills and Training**: Includes embedded systems design, 3D CAD modeling, servo control, audio sync programming, and process documentation.

### 💵 Financial Resources

- **Budget Overview**: Funded via personal savings, student grants, and part-time income. Limited, self-financed model.
- **Cost Tracking**: Expenses recorded in QuickBooks and linked to Obsidian budget reports per project milestone.

### 🧰 Material Resources

- **Materials List**: Includes servo motors, microcontroller boards, 3D-printed chassis parts, wiring, power modules, foam, and puppet construction materials.
- **Usage Plan**: Resources staged and consumed per milestone. Inventory tracked in `/Resources/Materials Register`.

### 📚 Information Resources

- **Data Sources**: ABB robotics courseware, Siemens S7-1200 manuals, servo datasheets, CAD file repositories, and project reference archives.
- **Access Plan**: Indexed in the `/Resources/Reference Index` with YAML-tagged files for dataview compatibility.

### ⏳ Time Management

- **Timeline**: Sequential, milestone-based Gantt chart built in `/Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/Documentation/Timeline.md`.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Weekly reflections, status updates, and sprint logs tracked in Obsidian daily notes and milestone review documents.

## 🗂 Document Management

### 🗺 Project Plan

- **Details**: Covers scope, deliverables, milestones, task registry, and resource map. Stored in `/Documentation/Project Plan.md`.

### 📈 Business Case

- **Justification**: Validates the project's purpose in advancing open-source animatronics and enhancing storytelling for the Control Freaks YouTube series.

### 🧱 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- **Visualization**: Mermaid WBS diagram maps out tasks under four primary phases with task codes (CD-T##, PD-T##, etc.).

### 📊 Gantt Chart

- **Schedule Representation**: Defined using `gantt` code blocks in Mermaid, ensuring clear task sequencing for solo workflow.

### ⚠ Risk Management Plan

- **Risk Assessment**: Potential points of failure (e.g., hardware burnout, servo lag, timing sync bugs) are tracked and mitigated in `/Risk Register.md`.

### 📡 Communication Plan

- **Communication Strategy**: Internal notes and updates logged in Obsidian. External updates managed via GitHub commits and YouTube post logs.

### 🧮 Resource Allocation Plan

- **Resource Usage**: Tied to milestone durations and dependencies. Resource usage mapped in timeline and task registry.

### 🔄 Change Management Documentation

- **Change Records**: All changes to design, components, and development approach logged in `/Change Log.md`.

### 🧾 Meeting Minutes and Reports

- **Meeting Documentation**: Reflected in personal sprint review logs, milestone planning docs, and task closeout summaries.

### 🛠 Quality Management Plan

- **Quality Standards**:
  - Servo latency tolerance: ±200 analog units.
  - Motion-audio sync: ≤ 50 ms.
  - Physical tolerances in puppet fit: ≤ 1.5 mm on moving joints.

### 👥 Stakeholder Register

- **Stakeholder Information**: Currently solo developer (Thomas Ware); placeholder entries for future collaborator roles.

### 💸 Budget Documents

- **Financial Details**: All purchases, projections, and category breakdowns tracked in `/Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/Budget.md`.

### 📄 Procurement Documents

- **Contracts and Agreements**: Purchase receipts, supplier notes, and procurement logs are stored in `/Archives/Procurement`.

### 🧾 Closure Report

- **Project Summary**: To be compiled post-launch, summarizing build process, system testing, documentation efforts, and future development roadmap.

---

**Note:**  
This plan is a living document. It will be reviewed **every 2 weeks** during milestone reflections and updated as the project scope, resources, or team status evolves. This ensures continuity, adaptability, and project success.
