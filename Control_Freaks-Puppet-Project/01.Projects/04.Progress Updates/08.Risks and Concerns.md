# ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks and Concerns

Clear identification and mitigation of risks ensure stability and adaptability throughout the Control Freaks Puppet Project.

---

### üö® Identified Risks

- **Risk 1 ‚Äì Prolonged PCB Debugging**
  - **Description**: PCB development may require extensive iteration due to unforeseen EMI, poor trace routing, or firmware conflicts‚Äîcommon with servo controller boards.
  - **Potential Impact**: May extend the Controller Development timeline, affecting Puppet and Show Pipeline Phases.

- **Risk 2 ‚Äì Burnout Risk (Solo Developer Constraint)**
  - **Description**: As a single developer managing all design, firmware, CAD, documentation, and video content, task overload may lead to burnout.
  - **Potential Impact**: Reduced productivity, skipped updates, or phase halts, potentially jeopardizing the final sync demo deadline.

- **Risk 3 ‚Äì 3D Print Failure for Puppet Parts**
  - **Description**: Structural components of the puppet head and jaw are to be printed. Print warping, under-extrusion, or fitting errors could cause significant delays.
  - **Potential Impact**: Delays PD-T03 (Shell Testing) and rework of Puppet CAD.

### üßØ Mitigation Strategies

- **Mitigation for Risk 1**:
  - Use proven layout best practices, simulate analog sections, and test in small subsystems before full layout.
  - Schedule early build reviews after CD-T05 (Netlist Finalization).

- **Mitigation for Risk 2**:
  - Apply strict sequential task execution (already implemented).
  - Insert periodic Review Points to offload decision fatigue and reduce context switching.

- **Mitigation for Risk 3**:
  - Implement part slicing and modular assembly.
  - Print critical fitting test pieces before full-size parts.

---

### üîç Risk Monitoring and Review

- **Monitoring Plan**:
  - Each task card contains a `risk_level` field updated weekly.
  - Obsidian tags like `#risk` and `#mitigate` will flag review items in Kanban updates.

- **Review Schedule**:
  - Risks will be reviewed every two weeks at Progress Update intervals or sooner if milestone blockers arise.

---

### üìÑ Contingency Planning

- **For PCB Delays**:
  - Prepare a fallback plan using off-the-shelf servo tester boards with PWM splitter logic.

- **For Burnout**:
  - Pause between each major milestone and allocate flexible buffer windows.

- **For Print Failures**:
  - Maintain backup filament stock and prioritize parts that can be reused with slight modifications.

---

### üì¢ Stakeholder Communication

- **Information Sharing**:
  - All risk items are mirrored in the weekly Progress Update note and Vault status board.

- **Feedback and Suggestions**:
  - Feedback is collected via `[!question]` blocks embedded in Kanban task notes. Suggestions are tagged `#feedback-request`.
