  - **Priority**: High  
  - **Resources Required**: KiCad project files, ERC settings documentation  
  - **Resource Availability**: Available

- **Next Step 2 – Puppet Shell Drafting (PD-T01)**  
  - **Description**: Begin sketching the puppet’s external shell design based on servo layout and aesthetic intent.  
  - **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware  
  - **Deadline**: 2025-06-19  
  - **Priority**: Medium  
  - **Resources Required**: Drawing tablet, concept notes

  - **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware  
  - **Deadline**: 2025-06-20  
  - **Priority**: High  
  - **Resources Required**: Obsidian + Task Metadata  
  - **Resource Availability**: Ready

### ⚖️ Prioritization

- Tasks CD-T03 and OV-T02 are **critical path** items and should be completed first.
- PD-T01 and SP-T01 are **important but flexible** in scheduling for this cycle.

---

### 🔍 Monitoring and Reporting

- **Progress Tracking**: Updates will be recorded in the task notes and Kanban board under `/Projects/Control Freaks Vault/Tasks Kanban.md`.  
- **Reporting Mechanism**: Weekly checkpoint summaries posted to `Progress_Updates_YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

---

### 🎯 Integration with Project Goals

- Each step directly supports a critical milestone in either controller development, design, or story pipeline phases.
- These actions set up the following tasks in sequence, respecting the solo developer constraint.

---

### ⚠️ Risk and Contingency Planning

- **CD-T03**: ERC failure may delay layout; fallback is manual net analysis.  
- **SP-T01**: Potential bottleneck if character details are not finalized—use placeholders and iterate later.

---

### 📣 Stakeholder Engagement

- Weekly summaries will be shared in the "Reviews" section of the vault.  
- Any blockers will be highlighted during Monday sync notes.
