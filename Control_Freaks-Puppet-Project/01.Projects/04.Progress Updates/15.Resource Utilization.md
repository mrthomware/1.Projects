# üîß Resource Utilization

An overview of how personnel, equipment, and materials are being used within the project to track efficiency and inform decisions.

---

### üë§ Human Resources

- **Allocation**: Solo developer model; all technical, documentation, and design work handled by Thomas Ware.
- **Utilization Rate**: 85% weekly utilization based on part-time schedule (~25 hours/week). Tasks are being executed in strict sequence to avoid overload.
- **Performance**: Strong progress in documentation and planning stages. Technical execution pending start of physical prototyping phase.
- **Adjustments Needed**: May need external consultation for PCB fabrication or CAD refinement in later phases if time constraints arise.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Equipment

- **Usage**:
  - Laptop workstation (Obsidian, CAD, firmware dev)
  - 3D printer (Ender 3 with resin kit) ‚Äì not yet engaged
  - Hand tools (fine assembly, soldering station) ‚Äì pending
- **Condition and Maintenance**:
  - Equipment in good condition; 3D printer recently calibrated and cleaned.
- **Efficiency**: All tools currently idle but staged for fabrication phase (July 2025).
- **Future Needs**:
  - Small logic analyzer or USB oscilloscope (recommended for controller debugging).
  - Backup soldering iron tip and precision tweezers for SMT work.

---

### üß± Materials

- **Consumption**:
  - Early usage: PLA for test prints, resistors/caps for breadboarding.
  - Significant material consumption expected to begin July 2025.
- **Inventory Levels**:
  - 70% of materials acquired for prototyping phase (PCBs, headers, microcontrollers still pending).
- **Wastage**: Minimal wastage to date due to pre-planning and test modeling.
- **Procurement Plans**:
  - Main electronics order from Digi-Key and PCBWay scheduled for early July.
  - Puppet armature foam and fabrics to be sourced locally (August phase).

---

### üìä Overall Assessment

- **Efficiency and Productivity**: Current usage is well-controlled. High efficiency in early planning/documentation stages with minimal waste or redundancy.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Budget being adhered to closely. Resources are being used purposefully, with most expenditure deferred until hardware phases.
- **Sustainability Considerations**:
  - Exploring reusable print supports and reduced-overhang design to minimize resin/PLA waste.
  - Plan to recycle packaging and use eco-conscious suppliers when possible.

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendations

- **Improvements and Adjustments**:
  - Create a real-time inventory sheet in Obsidian using Dataview for material tracking.
  - Begin sourcing optional tools ahead of need to avoid shipping delays.
- **Contingency Planning**:
  - If budget overruns occur, deprioritize foam latex sculpting in puppet development and use modular skeleton tests instead.
