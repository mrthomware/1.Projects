## ✅ Completed Tasks

- CD-T01 – Draft Servo Control Block Diagram  
- CD-T02 – Design Schematic in CAD Software

---

## 🕒 Upcoming Tasks

- CD-T03 – Perform ERC and Net Validation  
- PD-T01 – Draft Puppet Shell Concepts  
- OV-T02 – Structure PARA Folders  
- SP-T01 – Draft Pilot Script

## ⚠️ Current Issues and Challenges

- **Issue 1**: CAD software license needs renewal – may delay CD-T04  
- **Issue 2**: Limited access to printing filament colors – may impact PD-T08

---

## 🔧 Mitigation Actions

- Renewing software via academic license request (ETA: 2 business days)  
- Exploring alternate filament suppliers locally and online

---

## 💰 Budget Status

- **Total Budget**: $3,500  
- **Spent to Date**: $1,100  
- **Remaining**: $2,400  
- **Status**: On track, but hardware purchases pending in July

---

## 🧑‍🔧 Resource Utilization

- **Human Resources**: Solo developer (Thomas Ware); 8–10 hrs/week  
- **Equipment**: 3D printer functional; soldering station needs calibration  
- **Materials**: Servo samples received; puppet skin material delayed

---

## 🚨 Risks and Concerns

- **Risk 1**: Firmware complexity may exceed planned development window  
- **Risk 2**: Delays in puppet fabrication could impact show pipeline timeline

---

## 🔄 Change Requests

- **None this cycle.**

---

## 📣 Stakeholder Feedback

- Positive response from YouTube followers re: teaser announcement  
- Interest in behind-the-scenes design logs expressed
