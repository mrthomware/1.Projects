## ✅ Overall Project Status

### 📊 Status
- **Current Status**: On track  
- The project is currently aligned with planned timelines and deliverables. All major phase tasks are active or queued according to the master Gantt.

---

### 🏆 Key Highlights

- **Achievements**:
  - CD-T01 and CD-T02 completed successfully.
  - All controller PCB schematics reviewed and exported.
  - PD-T01 concept sketches finalized and reviewed.

- **Challenges and Issues**:
  - Minor delays encountered in CAD schematic routing due to a software license lapse.
  - Puppet material sourcing delayed pending vendor restock.

---

### 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Timeline Adherence**: ~92% of tasks are progressing according to plan  
- **Budget Status**: $1,100 spent out of $3,500 — within expected limits

---

### 🚨 Risk Assessment

- **Current Risks**:
  - Firmware logic may require longer development (CD-T11+)
  - Puppet joint design complexity could slow integration

- **Risk Mitigation**:
  - Created a fallback logic structure using pseudo code
  - Additional prototyping week added to buffer

---

### 🧑‍💼 Resource Utilization

- **Human Resources**: Solo development with average 10–12 hours/week  
- **Material Resources**: 3D printer and soldering tools operational; PLA and servo stock at 70%

---

### 📣 Stakeholder Feedback

- Received positive response on YouTube regarding teaser  
- Suggestions received for documenting firmware testing as behind-the-scenes content

---

### ⏭️ Forward Look

- **Next Steps**:
  - Complete CD-T03 through CD-T05  
  - Begin shell 3D printing and wiring mockups (PD-T04, PD-T07)

- **Adjustment Plans**:
  - Print extra prototype parts this cycle to reduce single-point delays
  - Automate voiceover syncing test (CD-T13) with temporary rig for fast iterations

---

### 📌 Conclusion

- **Overall Outlook**:  
  The project remains on track with buffer time intact. Primary risks are acknowledged with mitigation plans active. All major systems are progressing and communication with stakeholders is effective.
