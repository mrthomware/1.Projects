## **2. Feedback Details**

### **A. Concept Development**
| **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Stakeholder A       | The "Mad Scientist" theme needs more quirky props in the sketches.          | Add lab-specific props like bubbling beakers.   | In Progress       |
| Stakeholder B       | Color palette feels muted; consider brighter tones.                          | Revise sketches with vibrant color schemes.     | Pending           |

### **B. 3D Modeling**
| **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Stakeholder A       | The head-to-body ratio is slightly off, needs adjustment.                    | Refine proportions in the 3D model.             | In Progress       |
| Stakeholder C       | Texture details are too complex; simplify for clarity in animations.         | Simplify textures while maintaining aesthetics. | Not Started       |

### **C. Animation**
| **Feedback Source** | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Stakeholder B       | Puppet gestures feel stiff; add smoother transitions.                        | Refine animation curves for fluid motion.       | Pending Review    |
| Stakeholder A       | Expressions need more variety during dialogue.                               | Add subtle facial animations.                   | In Progress       |

## **3. Summary of Actions**
1. Revise sketches and 3D models to incorporate client suggestions on proportions and colors.
2. Simplify textures for better visual clarity in animations.
3. Enhance animation smoothness and expression variety.

---

## **4. Notes and Observations**
- Clients expressed enthusiasm for the whimsical elements but emphasized the need for balance with functionality.
- Iterative feedback is helping refine design and animation quality.
