## **2. Feedback Details**

### **A. Design**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer A           | The "Mad Scientist" theme is engaging but needs more exaggerated props.     | Add props like oversized test tubes and colorful vials. | In Progress       |
| Reviewer C           | The puppet’s outfit feels too plain for the whimsical theme.                 | Add embellishments to the lab coat and goggles. | Pending           |

### **B. Animation**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer B           | Walk cycles lack personality; add bounce and arm swing.                     | Refine walk cycle animations to include dynamic motion. | In Progress       |
| Reviewer A           | The transitions between movements feel abrupt.                              | Smoothen transitions using better interpolation techniques. | Pending           |

### **C. Prototyping**
| **Reviewer**         | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reviewer C           | Joint mechanics in the prototype need more flexibility.                     | Redesign joints for smoother articulation.      | Not Started       |
| Reviewer B           | The material for the puppet’s limbs appears too rigid.                      | Test softer materials for better range of motion. | Pending           |
