Hereâ€™s how you can structure a **Kanban board** for the **3D Puppet Design** project. The board will follow a logical progression of tasks from ideation to completion.

---

### **Kanban Columns**

1. **Backlog**
    - All tasks identified but not yet started.
2. **To Do**
    - Tasks ready to be picked up.
3. **In Progress**
    - Tasks currently being worked on.
4. **Review**
    - Tasks completed but awaiting feedback or approval.
5. **Done**
    - Completed tasks approved by stakeholders.

---

### **Task Breakdown**

Each task card should include:

- **Task Name** (e.g., "Create Concept Sketches")
- **Assignee** (e.g., Designer, Animator)
- **Due Date** (e.g., January 20, 2025)
- **Checklist/Subtasks** (e.g., "Sketch head, arms, joints")
- **Notes/Attachments** (e.g., links to files, references)

---

### **Example Tasks**

**Backlog**

- Research puppet design inspirations.
- Brainstorm features and styles.
- Create mood boards.

**To Do**

- Sketch initial puppet concepts.
- Define technical specifications.
- Identify required tools and software.

**In Progress**

- Develop the base 3D model.
- Add detailed features and textures.
- Prepare rigging for animation.

**Review**

- Stakeholder review of concept sketches.
- Feedback on the base 3D model.
- Review rigging and test animations.

**Done**

- Finalized 3D puppet model.
- Completed animation testing.
- Prototype approved for production.

### **How to Implement This Kanban Board**

Use a digital project management tool like:

- **Trello**: Create lists for each column and drag tasks across them as they progress.
- **Jira (Kanban View)**: Advanced features for tracking task dependencies and metrics.
- **Asana**: Board view with task descriptions and subtasks.
- **Notion**: Flexible boards integrated into your overall project management workspace.

---

### **Example Workflow**

1. **Add Tasks**: Populate the board with all known tasks.
2. **Assign Responsibilities**: Add assignees and due dates to each task card.
3. **Set Priorities**: Use labels or tags like "High Priority," "Low Priority," or "Urgent."
4. **Monitor Progress**: Conduct daily or weekly reviews of the board to identify blockers or delays.
5. **Iterate**: Update tasks and move them between columns as progress is made.
