#### **Subtasks**

1. **Review References**
    
    - Use mood boards and gathered inspirations as a foundation.
    - Identify essential elements to include (e.g., whimsical features, mad scientist theme, teaching functionality).
2. **Define Key Features**
    
    - Outline core elements of the puppet, including:
        - Proportions (e.g., head-to-body ratio).
        - Key articulations (e.g., movable mouth, limbs).
        - Accessories (e.g., goggles, props).
3. **Draft Rough Sketches**
    
    - Create several rough sketches to explore different styles and proportions.
    - Experiment with:
        - Face shapes (e.g., round, elongated).
        - Expressions (e.g., cheerful, eccentric).
        - Outfits and accessories.
4. **Refine Selected Concepts**
    
    - Select 2–3 sketches that best align with the project vision.
    - Add more detail to these sketches, including texture and material suggestions.
5. **Present to Stakeholders**
    
    - Share the refined sketches with stakeholders or the team for feedback.
    - Document feedback and prioritize adjustments.
6. **Finalize the Selected Concept**
    
    - Incorporate feedback into the final sketch.
    - Ensure the design aligns with the intended use (e.g., animation-ready or physical prototype).
