### **Task Card: Add Detailed Features and Textures**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Enhance the 3D puppet model by adding detailed features and realistic textures. This step ensures the puppet’s visual appeal aligns with the project’s creative and functional goals.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Finalize Model Base**
    
    - Ensure the base 3D model is clean and ready for detailed work.
    - Confirm symmetry and proper mesh topology for texturing.
2. **Add Fine Details**
    
    - Sculpt intricate features (e.g., wrinkles, fur, fabric patterns).
    - Focus on:
        - Facial expressions (e.g., smiles, frowns).
        - Character-specific elements (e.g., goggles, props, or tools).
3. **Define Material Properties**
    
    - Assign material types:
        - **Skin:** Smooth or textured with pores or wrinkles.
        - **Clothing:** Soft fabric appearance with folds.
        - **Accessories:** Metallic or plastic shine as needed.
4. **Apply Textures**
    
    - Use UV mapping to apply textures accurately.
    - Tools: Substance Painter, Blender, or Photoshop.
    - Include layers for:
        - Base colors.
        - Patterns and details.
        - Surface imperfections (e.g., scratches, stains).
5. **Test Rendering**
    
    - Set up basic lighting to preview textures under different conditions.
    - Render test images to ensure materials and features appear as intended.
6. **Iterate Based on Feedback**
    
    - Share renders with stakeholders for input.
    - Refine details and textures based on their suggestions.
7. **Export and Document**
    
    - Save high-resolution textures in organized folders.
    - Include notes on texture resolution, material settings, and file formats.

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Attach rendered images or turntables of the detailed model.
- Provide a list of texture maps (e.g., diffuse, normal, specular).

---

#### **Priority:**

High – Detailed features and textures are critical for creating a visually compelling and functional puppet model.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** when detailing begins.
- **Review Column:** Share detailed renders with stakeholders for feedback.
- **Done Column:** Mark as completed once the detailed model is approved.
