### **3D Puppet Design Project Overview**

---

#### **Project Title**:

**3D Puppet Design**

---

#### **Objective**:

The **3D Puppet Design** project aims to conceptualize, design, and produce a fully articulated 3D puppet that can be used for purposes such as animation, educational demonstrations, or physical prototyping. This puppet will feature a unique and engaging design inspired by animatronics and whimsical character styles, tailored to the project's specific goals and target audience.

---

#### **Scope**:

The project encompasses the following phases:

1. **Concept Development**:
    
    - Research design inspirations.
    - Brainstorm features and styles.
    - Create sketches and mood boards.
2. **3D Modeling and Detailing**:
    
    - Develop the base model and refine features.
    - Apply textures and materials.
3. **Rigging and Animation**:
    
    - Create a functional rig for animation.
    - Test movements and ensure articulation points meet project requirements.
4. **Prototyping** (if applicable):
    
    - Translate the digital design into a physical prototype using 3D printing or other methods.
5. **Review and Refinement**:
    
    - Collect feedback from stakeholders.
    - Iterate and finalize the design.

---

#### **Key Deliverables**:

1. Detailed concept sketches and mood boards.
2. A fully developed and textured 3D puppet model.
3. Rigged model ready for animation or physical prototyping.
4. Final review and documentation of the design process.

---

#### **Target Audience**:

This project is designed for creative and educational purposes, appealing to stakeholders such as:

- Animation studios or educators for visual demonstrations.
- Engineers or students interested in animatronics.
- Content creators seeking a custom puppet design.

---

#### **Timeline**:

The project is scheduled to take approximately **11 weeks** (2.5 months), divided into structured phases to ensure timely completion.

---

#### **Budget**:

The project budget is estimated at **$4,320**, covering design tools, software, prototyping materials, and other necessary resources.

---

#### **Key Success Criteria**:

1. Alignment of the design with stakeholder expectations and project goals.
2. Functional rigging and smooth animation compatibility.
3. High-quality deliverables, including a visually compelling and functional puppet model.
