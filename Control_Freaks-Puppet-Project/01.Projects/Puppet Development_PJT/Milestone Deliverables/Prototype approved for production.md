### **Task Card: Prototype Approved for Production**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Finalize and secure approval for the puppet prototype to move forward with production. Ensure all design, functionality, and material requirements are met and validated.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Prepare Prototype**
    
    - Verify that the prototype aligns with finalized 3D design specifications.
    - Ensure all functional components (e.g., articulation points, textures, and mechanisms) are operational.
    - For physical prototypes:
        - Inspect material quality (e.g., durability, texture).
        - Verify accurate assembly and finish.
2. **Perform Quality Assurance Tests**
    
    - Test the prototype’s structural integrity and articulation:
        - Move joints through full ranges of motion.
        - Simulate real-world use scenarios (e.g., movement patterns, stress testing).
    - Check for alignment with aesthetic and stylistic goals.
3. **Stakeholder Review**
    
    - Present the prototype to stakeholders for approval.
    - Collect detailed feedback on design, functionality, and usability.
4. **Document Adjustments**
    
    - Log feedback and required adjustments.
    - Make necessary refinements to the prototype.
5. **Secure Final Approval**
    
    - Ensure all stakeholder concerns are addressed.
    - Obtain formal sign-off to proceed with production.
6. **Prepare Production Files**
    
    - Compile all necessary files and documentation for production:
        - Finalized 3D model and animation files.
        - Material specifications and sourcing details.
        - Assembly instructions or schematics.

---

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Attach high-resolution images and videos of the prototype.
- Include feedback logs and a record of all adjustments made.

---

#### **Priority:**

Critical – Approval is required to move forward with production.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** when prototype preparation begins.
- **Review Column:** Submit prototype for stakeholder feedback and iterate as needed.
- **Done Column:** Mark as completed once prototype is approved and production files are prepared.
