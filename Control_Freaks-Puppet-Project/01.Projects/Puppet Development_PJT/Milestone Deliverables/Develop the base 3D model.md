### **Task Card: Develop the Base 3D Model**

---

#### **Status:**

Backlog → To Do (when ready to start)

---

#### **Task Description**

Create the base 3D model for the puppet, focusing on the foundational structure, proportions, and key articulations. This will serve as the framework for detailed design, rigging, and animation.

---

#### **Subtasks**

1. **Prepare Design References**
    
    - Compile mood boards, sketches, and technical specifications.
    - Identify critical features (e.g., articulation points, size, and shape).
2. **Select Software**
    
    - Use industry-standard tools like:
        - Blender (free and powerful for 3D modeling).
        - Autodesk Maya (advanced tools for modeling and animation).
        - ZBrush (ideal for detailed sculpting).
3. **Build the Framework**
    
    - Start with a low-poly model for easy adjustments.
    - Focus on:
        - Basic shapes and proportions.
        - Articulation points for rigging (e.g., joints for arms, legs, mouth).
        - Symmetry to maintain balance and consistency.
4. **Add Key Features**
    
    - Sculpt detailed elements like facial features, hands, and textures.
    - Test articulation by rotating or moving key joints to ensure functionality.
5. **Iterate and Refine**
    
    - Conduct internal reviews of the base model with the team or stakeholders.
    - Make adjustments based on feedback before moving to detailed sculpting.
6. **Prepare for Next Steps**
    
    - Export the model in required formats (e.g., `.obj`, `.fbx`, `.blend`).
    - Ensure compatibility with rigging and animation tools.

#### **Attachments & Notes**

- Save multiple iterations of the model for comparison.
- Attach notes detailing the software used and major adjustments made.

---

#### **Priority:**

High – The base model is critical for ensuring the success of subsequent rigging and detailing phases.

---

### **Kanban Board Integration**

- **Column:** Move to **In Progress** when modeling begins.
- **Review Column:** Share the base model for stakeholder feedback.
- **Done Column:** Once the model is finalized and approved, mark the task as completed.
