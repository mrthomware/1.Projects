# **Animation Review Notes 2025-01-20**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design
### **Date:** 2025-01-20

---

## **1. Overview**
These notes capture detailed observations and feedback from the animation review session conducted on **2025-01-20** for the **3D Puppet Design** project. The session focused on refining animations to align with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

## **2. Feedback and Observations**

### **A. General Animation**
1. **Gesture Transitions:**
   - Feedback: Transitions between key movements feel abrupt.
   - Action Required: Smoothen transitions using refined interpolation techniques.
   - Assigned To: Animation Team  
2. **Dynamic Range:**
   - Feedback: Movements lack dynamic range in certain sequences.
   - Action Required: Add exaggerated motions for emphasis where appropriate.
   - Assigned To: Animation Lead  

### **B. Facial Animation**
1. **Expressions:**
   - Feedback: Facial expressions need to convey more nuanced emotions.
   - Action Required: Enhance eyebrow and mouth movements for better clarity.
   - Assigned To: Facial Animation Specialist  
2. **Lip-Sync:**
   - Feedback: Lip-sync timing is slightly misaligned with audio.
   - Action Required: Adjust timing for better accuracy.
   - Assigned To: Lip-Sync Coordinator  

### **C. Physics and Dynamics**
1. **Prop Interaction:**
   - Feedback: Minor clipping observed when puppet interacts with props.
   - Action Required: Refine collision settings and test interactions.
   - Assigned To: Physics Specialist  
2. **Hair Motion:**
   - Feedback: Hair dynamics appear unnatural during rapid movements.
   - Action Required: Adjust simulation parameters for improved realism.
   - Assigned To: Dynamics Specialist

## **3. Key Notes**
- **Stakeholder Input:**
  - Stakeholders emphasized the importance of making animations more engaging and aligned with the puppetâ€™s whimsical theme.
  - Attention to secondary motion was highlighted as a priority.
- **Team Collaboration:**
  - Feedback suggests stronger collaboration between animation and physics teams for better integration.
