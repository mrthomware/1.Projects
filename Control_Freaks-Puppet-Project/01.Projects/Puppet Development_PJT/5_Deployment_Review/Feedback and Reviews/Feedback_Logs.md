# **Feedback Logs**

## **Project:** 3D Puppet Design

---

## **1. Overview**
This document serves as a consolidated log for all feedback received during the **3D Puppet Design** project. Feedback is categorized by phase and includes actionable insights to guide refinements.

## **2. Feedback by Phase**

### **A. Concept Development**
| **Date**       | **Source**           | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder A        | Preferred whimsical elements with exaggerated props.                        | Add thematic props like glowing gadgets.        | In Progress       |
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder B        | Color palette is too muted for the intended tone.                           | Update with brighter, more vibrant colors.      | Pending           |

### **B. 3D Modeling**
| **Date**       | **Source**           | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Animation Expert     | Head-to-body ratio requires refinement for better expressiveness.           | Adjust proportions in the 3D model.             | In Progress       |
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder C        | Textures are overly detailed; simplify for animation clarity.               | Reduce texture complexity.                      | Not Started       |

### **C. Animation**
| **Date**       | **Source**           | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Animator A           | Walk cycle animations lack smooth transitions.                              | Refine interpolation for gesture transitions.   | Pending Review    |
| [Insert Date]  | Reviewer B           | Lip-sync needs to match dialogue more accurately.                           | Fine-tune lip-sync timing.                      | Not Started       |

### **D. Prototyping**
| **Date**       | **Source**           | **Feedback**                                                                 | **Action Required**                              | **Status**        |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Insert Date]  | Prototyping Specialist | Joints feel too stiff in the physical model.                                | Adjust joint mechanics for smoother articulation. | Not Started       |
| [Insert Date]  | Stakeholder D        | Material for limbs needs improved flexibility for usability.                | Test softer materials for durability.           | Pending           |
