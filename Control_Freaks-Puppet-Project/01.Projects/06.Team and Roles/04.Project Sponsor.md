- Promotes the mission of the Control Freaks Puppet Project across all initiatives—from technical development to YouTube content delivery.
- Ensures the project aligns with the creator's brand strategy and long-term storytelling objectives.

### 💰 Resource Provision
- Secures and allocates funding (e.g., student grants, business investments, equipment purchases).
- Approves budget changes for major components like servo controllers, audio modules, and fabrication tools.

### 🧭 Strategic Decision-Making
- Resolves cross-phase conflicts (e.g., when puppet articulation compromises show timing).
- Makes high-level calls on version pivots (e.g., switching from analog to I2C for servo sync).

### 📣 Stakeholder Engagement
- Represents the project’s progress to:
  - Viewers and subscribers (through devlogs or behind-the-scenes content)
  - Instructors or advisors (if seeking academic credit or collaboration)
  - Grant agencies or potential sponsors

### 🔍 Guidance and Oversight
- Directs project reviews at major milestones:
  - End of schematic design
  - Completion of mechanical rig testing
  - First full puppet-actuated audio sync demo
- Provides advisory support on feature prioritization and phase transitions.

### ⚠️ Risk Management
- Identifies strategic risks (e.g., project scope creep, burnout from multi-role workload).
- Ensures fallback plans (e.g., modular puppet design, reduced servo count pilot version).
