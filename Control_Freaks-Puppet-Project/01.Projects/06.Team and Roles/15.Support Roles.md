## 🛠️ Support Roles – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

In the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, support roles encompass administrative and informal HR functions, which—though typically minimal in a solo or micro-team setting—are still essential for maintaining order, reducing cognitive load, and enabling focused creative and technical execution. These functions are often self-managed by the project lead but still benefit from structured delegation or automation where possible.

### 🧾 Support Role Types and Functions

#### 🗂️ Administrative Support

- **Documentation Management**: Organize folders, track version histories of files (e.g., schematics, firmware, puppet designs).
- **Meeting and Task Logs**: Record and timestamp planning notes, reflections, and sprint completions in Obsidian or Kanban tools.
- **Scheduling and Time Blocking**: Maintain a project calendar to avoid deadline drift and burnout, especially for hobbyist workflows.
- **Digital Asset Organization**: Manage file naming, backup routines, and cloud syncing for CAD files, microcontroller code, and video media.

#### 🧑‍💼 Human Resource-Like Functions

- **Self-Assessment Logs**: Document skill gaps and plan technical upskilling (e.g., STM32 debugging, puppet skin material tests).
- **Tool Familiarization Training**: Schedule personal time for learning new CAD workflows, soldering techniques, or firmware libraries.
- **Emotional Checkpoints**: Log stress indicators, burnout symptoms, or creative blocks to prompt proactive rest or review.

### 📌 Responsibilities

- **Operational Efficiency**: Ensure all tasks unrelated to fabrication, design, or coding are structured to reduce mental overhead.
- **Resource Planning**: Forecast needs for consumables (resistors, servos, foam latex, 3D print filament) and schedule restocks or purchases.
- **File and Asset Control**: Avoid duplicated or lost data through periodic backups and GitHub syncs.
- **Compliance and Licensing**: Track licenses for any 3rd-party content, software libraries (e.g., MIT license), or Creative Commons assets used in videos.
- **Process Templates and SOPs**: Document procedures (e.g., “How to reset servo EEPROMs” or “Weekly cable check SOP”) to avoid rework.
- **Tool Maintenance Logs**: Schedule checks for soldering tips, multimeter calibration, and servo testers.
- **Communication Readiness**: Maintain preformatted project update templates, documentation export folders, or academic submission checklists.

### 🧠 Contextual Application

Although this project is led by a solo developer, defining support roles enables automation of routine tasks and reduces project friction. Even simple actions like maintaining clean folder structures, pre-written YAML headers, and templated bug report forms can make the project feel lighter and more efficient.
