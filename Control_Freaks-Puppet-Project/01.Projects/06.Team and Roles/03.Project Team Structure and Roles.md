# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Project Team Structure and Roles for Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

## 📘 Introduction

This document serves as the definitive reference for defining, assigning, and understanding the roles within the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**. It ensures each contributor knows their responsibilities and how they align with the broader objectives of building a fully integrated animatronic storytelling system.

Its purpose is to:
- Provide a centralized view of the team composition.
- Support clear communication of duties.
- Promote accountability and reduce role ambiguity.

As this is a complex solo-led prototyping effort, some roles may be merged or sequentially assumed. This document is designed to scale as contributors are added.

---

## 🔧 Resource Manager

- **Responsibilities**: Manages prototyping materials (PLA, wires, servo horns, brackets, controllers) and workspace setup (bench, printer, solder station).

---

## 🔄 Change Manager

- **Responsibilities**: Integrates design iteration changes (CAD updates, firmware versioning, script rewrites) without disrupting linked pipeline phases.

---

## ⚠️ Risk Manager

- **Responsibilities**: Identifies technical, scope, or supply chain risks and outlines mitigation strategies (e.g., alternate parts, simplified prototypes, fallback firmware).

---
