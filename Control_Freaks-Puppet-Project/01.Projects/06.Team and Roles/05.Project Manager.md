---

## 🎯 Role Summary

The **Project Manager** for the Control Freaks Puppet Project is responsible for ensuring that the entire development process—from controller prototyping to final puppet deployment and media publication—is delivered efficiently, on time, and within resource constraints. In this solo-led project, the role is self-managed by Thomas Ware.

## 📌 Responsibilities

### 📅 Planning
- Develops the full project plan using Obsidian Vault task structures, Gantt charts, and Milestone documents.
- Defines scope, deliverables, and timelines across all four major phases:
  - Controller Development
  - Puppet Development
  - Show Pipeline Development
  - Obsidian Vault Integration
- Allocates time blocks and defines resource requirements per task.

### 🚀 Execution
- Coordinates sequential task execution.
- Ensures build dependencies are respected (e.g., no firmware until PCB is tested).
- Performs hands-on work across engineering, documentation, and creative scripting.

### 📊 Monitoring and Control
- Reviews progress using the Task Index, Kanban board, and milestone tracking.
- Adjusts scope, priorities, or order if a bottleneck arises (e.g., broken part, CAD rework).
- Tracks how time estimates align with real development pace and updates the plan.

### ✅ Closure
- Validates when phases are completed based on deliverable readiness (e.g., demo-ready puppet rig or documented servo control firmware).
- Compiles end-of-phase summaries and performance notes.
- Conducts retrospective assessments on time, quality, and execution for each stage.

## 🔗 Primary Contact

### Stakeholder Liaison
- Interfaces with:
  - Potential collaborators (e.g., voice actors, script writers, reviewers)
  - Online audiences and social communities
  - Personal mentors and academic advisors (when applicable)

### Team Performance Management

- Reflects regularly on productivity, burnout risk, and bottlenecks in execution.
- Establishes self-review checkpoints and status logging rituals within Obsidian.

## 🧾 Project Context

The Project Manager role in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** is uniquely challenging due to its solo-execution nature. Strategic delegation is simulated by separating execution zones in Obsidian, while sequential planning avoids multitasking conflicts. Consistent self-discipline and documentation ensure sustainable project execution.
