# 🛠️ Technical Lead / Architect – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

## 🎯 Role Summary

In the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, the **Technical Lead / Architect** oversees the design, development, integration, and performance of all technical systems—including servo controllers, mechanical rigging, firmware, and audio sync.

As the sole contributor, Thomas Ware fulfills this role by combining engineering precision, creative adaptability, and system-level foresight. This document outlines the responsibilities and strategic value of this role within the project.

## 📌 Responsibilities

### 🔭 Technical Vision and Leadership
- Establishes the technical blueprint across all project phases:
  - PCB design and firmware architecture
  - Puppet actuation and servo mapping
  - Show pipeline synchronization and integration
- Defines the long-term scalability roadmap (e.g., modular puppet control, multi-puppet coordination)

### 🧩 Solution Design
- Chooses and integrates:
  - Servo controller protocols (PWM, I2C, SPI)
  - Microcontroller platforms (e.g., ATmega, STM32, ESP32)
  - Audio synchronization strategies (timestamped triggers, waveform parsing, etc.)
- Designs fault-tolerant systems that enable test-recover cycles and debug hooks.

### 🧰 Resource Management
- Allocates and configures:
  - Development tools: firmware editors, CAD platforms
  - Hardware: test rigs, servos, driver boards, power modules
- Ensures efficient reuse of mechanical and electrical components across iterations.

### 🛠️ Technical Problem Solving
- Diagnoses:
  - Servo jitter or lag issues
  - Analog noise in sensor feedback
  - Firmware timing desynchronization
- Iterates circuit and mechanical designs to reduce failure modes and increase modularity.

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- Implements:
  - Manual and automated movement tests
  - Output validation routines (e.g., pulse width stability, load variance logging)
  - Voltage safety limits and current draw tracking
- Conducts self-review cycles and phase sign-offs for mechanical/electrical readiness.

### 🔌 Integration
- Coordinates:
  - Firmware sync with show control timelines
  - Puppetry rig with Obsidian-driven design documentation
  - Audio triggers with real-time actuator response

### 🎓 Mentorship and Guidance
- Although solo, the technical lead role maintains:
  - A culture of structured development
  - Version-controlled documentation and retrospectives for future collaborators or expansion

### 📣 Stakeholder Communication
- Translates complex technical decisions into clear summaries for:
  - Non-technical YouTube viewers (via devlogs)
  - Academic or grant-related reviews
  - Mentors providing guidance or design critique

## 🧾 Contextual Note

The Technical Lead role underpins the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** by ensuring that hardware, software, and mechanical systems interact flawlessly to deliver a smooth, expressive, and reliable puppet performance system. Even in a solo dev environment, architectural thinking ensures durability, extendability, and maintainability of each solution.
