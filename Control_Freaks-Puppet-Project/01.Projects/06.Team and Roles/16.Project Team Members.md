## 👥 Project Team Members – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

In the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, project team members include specialists across technical, creative, and storytelling disciplines. While this is currently a solo-led initiative, the project is designed for future scalability, collaboration, and delegation. Each defined role reflects a potential area of responsibility that may eventually be filled by a contributor or systematized through automation, tooling, or documentation.

### 🔧 Roles and Areas of Expertise

#### ⚙️ Embedded Systems Engineer
- Designs, debugs, and implements microcontroller-based control systems (e.g., servo controller board).
- Writes firmware to sync servo motion with audio cues.

#### 🎨 Character Designer & Puppet Fabricator
- Translates blackbook sketches into full physical puppet builds.
- Oversees aesthetic continuity and material selection (e.g., foam latex, silicone skin).

#### 🛠️ Mechanical Designer / Mechatronics Specialist
- Develops puppet mechanisms, such as linkages for mouth/eye motion.
- Designs in CAD and prepares for 3D printing or machining.

#### 🧪 Systems Tester & QA Contributor
- Tests mechanical assemblies and firmware loops.
- Validates behavior against expected outputs under various conditions.

#### 📊 Documentation and PKM Specialist
- Maintains PARA-based Obsidian vault with detailed process records.
- Structures design decisions, version history, and templates for reproducibility.

#### 🎥 Cinematics and Pipeline Developer
- Builds the shot pipeline for storytelling and recording.
- Coordinates storyboard design, puppet staging, and camera blocking.

### 📌 Responsibilities

- **Execute Specializations**: Carry out technical, creative, or organizational tasks aligned to each role’s domain. E.g., soldering servo drivers, sculpting puppet foam forms, writing scripts for scene timing.
- **Maintain Obsidian Documentation**: Update task completion notes, bug reports, and decision logs in the Control Freaks Vault.
- **Collaborate with Roles**: Maintain cross-domain awareness. Example: character design influences mechanical motion design; firmware timing depends on motion range.
- **Iterate and Improve**: Reflect on puppet design, firmware sync accuracy, or visual staging quality—then iterate based on feedback or new research.
- **Time Management**: Respect defined Gantt milestones and solo-developer pacing constraints. Avoid task stacking; work sequentially.

### 🔍 Contextual Consideration

Even as a solo effort, thinking in terms of defined **team roles** allows better compartmentalization, sharper focus, and future delegation readiness. These roles provide a mental framework for breaking up complex processes (like syncing audio to servo timing) and isolating concerns (like design fidelity vs. mechanical limits).
