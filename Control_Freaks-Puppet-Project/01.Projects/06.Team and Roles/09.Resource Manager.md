## 🧰 Resource Manager – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

The **Resource Manager** in the Control Freaks Puppet Project is responsible for ensuring that all necessary materials, components, tools, workspace access, and time allocations are available and efficiently managed. Since the project is executed by a solo developer (Thomas Ware), this role emphasizes careful planning and realistic scheduling across all tasks and phases.

---

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 👤 Human Resource Allocation
- **Solo Workload Mapping**: Distributes task durations across the entire Gantt timeline to prevent overwork or resource conflicts.
- **Time Tracking**: Logs hours spent per task to adjust future estimations (especially in Controller Development and Puppet Fabrication phases).

#### 🧱 Material Resource Management
- **Inventory Tracking**:
  - Maintains lists of servo motors, wire sets, 3D filament, PCB supplies, etc.
  - Monitors usage of prototyping materials across iterations.
- **Procurement**:
  - Orders servo horns, M3 bolts, cables, controller parts based on BOM from CAD and schematic documentation.
  - Ensures key parts (e.g., spare servos) are purchased early to avoid production delays.

#### 📅 Resource Planning & Forecasting
- Aligns component delivery timelines with Gantt milestones.
- Accounts for potential backorders or supplier delays (adds procurement buffer time).

#### 💰 Budget Management
- Tracks project expenses across:
  - Electronics (MCU, servos, PCB fabrication)
  - Fabrication (filament, resin, fasteners)
  - Tools & equipment (e.g., soldering station, multimeter)
- Ensures total cost remains within a set solo-prototype budget.

#### 📈 Performance Monitoring
- Reviews effectiveness of resources per phase:
  - Did the servo perform adequately for the mouth sync?
  - Was the PLA material strong enough for jaw movement?
- Logs equipment wear/failure to avoid reuse of unreliable parts.

#### 🤝 Collaboration & Conflict Mitigation
- Resolves resource conflicts internally (i.e., if one servo is needed for multiple prototypes).
- Coordinates between the design schedule and availability of workspace/tools.

#### 📋 Compliance & Risk Management
- Verifies electrical components meet safety/compatibility standards.
- Logs risks tied to unavailable or fragile components (e.g., lost controller firmware cable).

### 🧾 Project Context

In the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, resource efficiency is paramount due to limited team size, budget, and fabrication bandwidth. The Resource Manager role is therefore designed to integrate material control, timeline discipline, and cost forecasting — ensuring the solo developer doesn’t overcommit or underprepare for any task.
