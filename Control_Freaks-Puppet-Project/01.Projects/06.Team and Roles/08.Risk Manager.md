## 🛡️ Risk Manager – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

The **Risk Manager** is responsible for proactively identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential risks that could disrupt the progress, safety, or quality of the Control Freaks Puppet Project. Since this is a solo-developed project, Thomas Ware fulfills the Risk Manager role as part of his planning and QA routines.

---

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 🔍 Risk Identification
- Reviews the design and fabrication steps for mechanical, electrical, and firmware vulnerabilities.
- Common risks include:
  - Servo overheating
  - 3D print failure during demo prep
  - Power supply instability
  - Timeline delays due to firmware debugging

---

#### 📊 Risk Analysis
- Evaluates:
  - **Probability** of risk (e.g., print warping in summer = high)
  - **Impact severity** (e.g., corrupted microcontroller flash = critical halt)
- Classifies risks as:
  - **Acceptable**: monitor, low impact
  - **Manageable**: requires contingency
  - **Critical**: preemptive redesign or resourcing needed

---

#### 📋 Mitigation Planning
- Examples of strategies:
  - Use heat sinks on servo drivers (to reduce thermal risk)
  - Maintain backup microcontroller and firmware image
  - Add buffer time in project Gantt chart
  - Use pre-tested demo rig for presentation

---

#### 📈 Monitoring and Reporting
- Tracks:
  - Risk journal in Obsidian Vault
  - Weekly review of active vs dormant risks
  - Logs changes in severity levels as development progresses

---

#### 📣 Communication
- Notes risk categories during video logs and project status updates
- Documents risks with YAML and dataview queries for transparency across development logs

---

#### 🚨 Crisis Management
- Maintains action plans for:
  - Puppet armature breakage during sync tests
  - Servo failure on launch day
  - File loss or hardware failure (uses regular Git commits and backups)

---

#### 🔄 Review and Adaptation
- Revisits and revises:
  - Risk registry after major build phases (controller PCB complete, rig fully assembled)
  - Mitigation strategies after each issue report from testing

---

#### 🤝 Collaboration
- Integrates risk mitigation directly into:
  - Firmware test plans
  - Gantt scheduling
  - Controller debugging steps
- Cross-referenced with QA and Technical Lead responsibilities for holistic coverage

---

### 🧾 Project Context

The Risk Manager role ensures that the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** stays resilient and adaptable. With a high dependency on servo control precision, show synchronization, and hardware-software interfacing, risk awareness is critical to project success.
