## ✔️ Quality Assurance (QA) Manager – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

The **QA Manager** is responsible for validating the reliability, precision, and performance of every system involved in the Control Freaks Puppet Project. From ensuring servo responsiveness to verifying show sync integrity, this role safeguards the quality and consistency of the final user experience.

For this solo-led project, Thomas Ware performs quality control tasks across firmware, hardware, mechanical assemblies, and digital workflows.

---

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 🧾 Quality Standards Development
- Establishes functional acceptance thresholds:
  - Servo accuracy: motion must remain within ±5° of expected value
  - Audio sync lag: no more than 100ms drift
  - Frame integrity: puppet must maintain structural stability during high-speed motion
- Aligns testing standards with hobbyist-grade robotics reliability benchmarks and audience perception standards.

---

#### 🧪 Testing and Validation
- Develops test plans for:
  - Servo rotation consistency
  - Endstop calibration
  - Load tolerance under stress (e.g., mouth opening, head tilt)
- Performs both manual checks and video-based test playback to assess timing and visual accuracy.

---

#### 🐞 Issue Identification and Resolution
- Logs issues including:
  - Servo jitter
  - Firmware misfire
  - Power supply irregularities
- Coordinates with the Technical Lead role (self) to implement hotfixes or redesigns.

---

#### ♻️ Process Improvement
- Continuously iterates on:
  - QA test templates within Obsidian
  - Recording and playback tools for sync validation
  - Error response protocols (e.g., voltage drop during rapid servo cycles)

---

#### 🧠 Training and Standards Documentation
- Maintains documentation for:
  - Mechanical assembly tests
  - Visual cue alignment (mouth open-to-audio peak ratio)
  - Firmware loadout checklists for each test cycle

---

#### 📈 Reporting and Documentation
- Logs:
  - Test dates
  - Results
  - Fixes applied
- Produces QA summary reports at the end of each project phase, stored in the Obsidian Vault

---

#### 📣 Stakeholder Communication
- Communicates:
  - QA status and limitations during development vlogs
  - Key reliability metrics for demo readiness

---

#### 🧩 Compliance and Audits
- Ensures:
  - Electrical components remain within safe spec
  - Assembly is safe for public handling or demo interaction
  - Mechanical fastenings are redundant where safety is critical (e.g., eye rotation or jaw actuation)

---

### 🧾 Project Context

In the **Control Freaks Puppet Project**, the QA Manager role is essential to making the puppets not just functional, but performance-ready for video and live scenarios. It ensures each subsystem is evaluated holistically, maintaining viewer trust and creative fidelity.
