## 📣 Communications Coordinator – Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

### 🎯 Role Summary

In the Control Freaks Puppet Project, the **Communications Coordinator** ensures that critical information flows smoothly across all phases—from controller development to puppet performance documentation. Since the project includes both technical and creative elements (hardware, show scripting, YouTube content), clear and strategic communication is vital for internal alignment and public engagement.

### 📌 Responsibilities

#### 🧭 Internal Communication Management
- Maintains a centralized **Obsidian-based log** of project updates, changes, and meeting summaries.
- Issues weekly summaries of progress milestones and pending actions across phases (e.g., PCB readiness, puppet assembly status).
- Manages asynchronous collaboration notes for solo work tracking.

#### 🌐 External Communication
- Prepares project updates for:
  - **YouTube community posts** (e.g., build progress, teaser reveals).
  - **Maker forums or Discord groups** interested in animatronics or DIY controllers.
  - **School project reports** if the build overlaps with course credit or lab assessments.
- Develops outreach drafts for potential sponsors, mentors, or collaborators.

#### 📋 Communication Strategy Development
- Defines the **tone, timing, and tools** used for updates:
  - Technical logs in Obsidian
  - Public content via LinkedIn or YouTube
  - Task and milestone comms through Kanban notes
- Ensures branding consistency between visual content and technical documentation.

#### ✍️ Content Creation and Distribution
- Drafts:
  - Instructional documentation for the build process.
  - YouTube scripts and narration summaries.
  - Social post templates tied to milestone completions.
- Uses Markdown, plain text, and image annotations to distribute formatted content.

#### 🚨 Crisis Communication
- Maintains a **communication protocol** for:
  - Major delays (e.g., supplier part shortage)
  - System failures (e.g., PCB not functioning as expected)
- Quickly drafts situation summaries with next-step actions for logs and external updates.

#### 📥 Feedback Mechanisms
- Collects insights and reactions from:
  - YouTube comments
  - Peer reviews
  - Stakeholder (educator, viewer, or mentor) feedback
- Compiles feedback logs for use during project retrospectives or final reporting.

#### 🎨 Brand and Image Management
- Ensures visual content (e.g., banner art, technical diagrams) aligns with the Control Freaks identity.
- Audits communications for tone consistency—technical pieces remain professional, while puppet content is character-driven and fun.

#### 📊 Monitoring and Reporting
- Tracks engagement with public posts and internal docs.
- Reports on post-performance (e.g., which update type drove the most interaction or helped troubleshoot issues fastest).

### 🧾 Project Context

Given the multifaceted nature of the Control Freaks Puppet Project, the Communications Coordinator is the voice that maintains cohesion between engineering logic and character-based entertainment. The role enables a streamlined flow of information from sketchbook to soldering iron to screen—ensuring that the solo developer (you) never loses sight of the “why” behind each “how.”
