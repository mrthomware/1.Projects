### 🕓 Deadline Tracking

- **At-Risk**: PD-T02 may push back 3D print queue if not completed by 2025-06-08.
- **On Track**: All other dependent tasks remain within buffer margins.

---

### ⚙️ Resource Utilization

- PD-T02 running at 1.2x projected time due to CAD constraints.
- No overspend yet on filament, electronics, licenses, or software.
- OV-T01 backup resources secured and on standby.

---

### 🔄 Review and Reporting

- **Weekly Review Day**: Friday mornings
- **Status Reports**: Updated in `/Logs/Progress_Reports.md`
- **Team Updates**: Delivered via Slack + Vault sync
- **Feedback Channels**: Peer review comments embedded in Vault notes per task

---

### 🚨 Adjustments & Contingencies

- **Contingency Plan for PD-T02**: Simplified jaw system fallback design in place
- **Plan B for SP-T06**: Green screen swap-in if puppet servo calibration underperforms
- **Backup Timeline for OV-T01**: External snapshot prep available if Vault sync fails
