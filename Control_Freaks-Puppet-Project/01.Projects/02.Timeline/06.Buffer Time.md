# ⏳ Buffer Time – Control Freaks Vault

Strategically placed buffer time increases resilience in the *Control Freaks* project schedule by absorbing small delays and reducing timeline risks without compromising delivery deadlines. Buffer time is essential to maintain agility in a solo developer environment where task shifting is not parallelized.

## 🧩 Task-Specific Buffers (All Phases)

| Buffer Location           | Duration | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| After **PD-T02 – 3D CAD Modeling**       | 1 day    | Accommodates last-minute model changes or file conversion issues.       |
| After **PD-T05 – 3D Printing**          | 2 days   | Covers print failures, part defects, or resin/filament restocking.      |
| After **PD-T09 – Puppet Assembly**      | 1 day    | Allows mechanical rework or servo misalignment corrections.             |
| After **CD-T08 – Board Assembly**       | 1 day    | Covers solder rework, shorts, or burnt components.                      |
| After **CD-T13 – Audio Sync Integration**| 1 day    | Gives room for sync bugs or timing loop mismatches.                     |
| After **SP-T09 – Video Editing**        | 2 days   | Protects against render glitches, unsynced audio, or missing transitions.|
| After **OV-T02 – PARA Structuring**     | 1 day    | Absorbs reorganization or note migration delays.                        |

## 🧮 Overall Project Buffer

- **End-of-Project Buffer**: **3 days**
  - Applied before **OV-T08 – Final Vault Summary**
  - Protects against cumulative delays in documentation, publishing, or vault exports.
  - Helps ensure on-time delivery for final project closeout.

## 📊 Managing Buffer Time

- **Usage Tracking**:
  - Tracked in `Delay_Log.md` with timestamp, blocker description, and consumed buffer days.
  - Reviewed during weekly Sunday project reviews.

- **Thresholds**:
  - If more than **1 day per phase** is consumed, a deviation alert is triggered.
  - Critical Path buffer tasks are locked once consumed—no rescheduling allowed without justification.

- **Flex Adjustments**:
  - Unused buffer time from non-critical tasks (e.g., **SP-T02 – Storyboarding**) may be reassigned.
  - Early completions may allow extra content (e.g., bonus BTS clip or rig documentation).

---

## 🧠 Allocation Strategy

- **Critical Path Focused**: Buffers are weighted toward tasks that influence servo control, physical fabrication, and performance capture.
- **Solo Developer Reality**: Task fatigue, unexpected life interruptions, or hardware failures are preemptively accounted for.
- **Creative Flexibility**: Creative steps (sketching, puppeteering) are treated with “soft buffers” to respect organic workflow pace.

**Note**: This buffer framework ensures that production remains agile, adaptive, and protected from avoidable overruns while keeping final publishing on schedule.
