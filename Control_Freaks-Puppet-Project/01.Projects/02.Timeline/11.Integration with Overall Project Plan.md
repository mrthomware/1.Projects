## üß© Integration with Overall Project Plan ‚Äì Control Freaks Vault

This section documents the consistency checks across the project timeline, budget estimates, resource allocations, and the risk mitigation framework to ensure unified execution and planning discipline.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Consistency Check Overview

**Objective:**  
Ensure that the Control Freaks puppet production plan aligns with supporting documents: the Budget Plan, Resource Allocation Sheet, and Risk Management Framework.

---

### üí∞ 2. Budget Consistency Check

**Purpose:**  
Confirm all tasks and milestones are within budget scope and funding allocations.

**Steps:**

1. **Review Budget Allocation**
   - Each milestone (e.g., PD-T03 ‚Äì 3D Printing, CD-T05 ‚Äì Electronics Procurement) has a corresponding budget line item in `Budget_Plan.md`.
   - Allocation matches material costs, license fees, and labor estimates.

2. **Identify Budget Variances**
   - CD-T02 CAD duration slightly exceeded projection due to added rig complexity.
   - SP-T11 (Video Editing) has added $30 for new SFX assets.

3. **Adjustments and Reconciliation**
   - Adjusted contingency buffer in the budget to absorb SFX asset purchase.
   - All task lines are now fully aligned with the revised budget.

**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Budget plan reconciled and matched to timeline and task list with no unresolved cost overruns.

### üßë‚Äçüîß 3. Resource Plan Consistency Check

**Purpose:**  
Ensure that required tools, personnel, and digital assets are allocated and available for all planned activities.

**Steps:**

1. **Resource Allocation Review**
   - Matched all `Resource_Allocation.md` entries to task IDs in `Tasks_and_Activities.md`.
   - CAD software, 3D printers, servo test kits, and sound booths are reserved.

2. **Resource Availability Verification**
   - Confirmed Prusa i3 MK3S+ availability post-2025-06-08.
   - Electronics components procured and stocked in lab.

3. **Adjustments**
   - No conflicts; shift in CAD deadline accommodated with updated printer reservation.

**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ Resource plan aligned with execution timeline; no shortages anticipated.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Risk Management Plan Consistency Check

**Purpose:**  
Ensure all known risks are addressed and mitigated in the project schedule.

**Steps:**

1. **Risk Identification Cross-Check**
   - Key risks from `Risk_Management_Log.md` (e.g., servo failure, CAD print mismatch) are tagged in task planning.

2. **Mitigation Strategy Review**
   - PD-T03 includes buffer for reprints; CD-T06 includes alternate fallback script for basic motion demo.
   - Risk log cross-referenced in `Buffer_Time.md`.

3. **Adjustments**
   - Mid-project review point (2025-06-20) added to flag technical blockers.

**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ All identified risks are addressed through timeline buffers, fallback plans, and milestone checkpoints.

---

### üîÅ 5. Final Integration Review

**Purpose:**  
Complete consolidation and approval of all key documents supporting the execution plan.

**Steps:**

1. **Consolidated Review**
   - Milestones, task lists, budget, and risks now cross-linked via internal backlinks and tags in the Vault.
   - Timeline Gantt chart and Kanban board reflect updated dependencies and buffers.

2. **Stakeholder Approval**
   - Final review to be held on 2025-06-09.
   - Sign-off required from: Thomas Ware, Engineering Lead, Production Editor.

**Outcome:**  
‚úÖ All documents reconciled and validated. Control Freaks project is ready to proceed with execution phase.
