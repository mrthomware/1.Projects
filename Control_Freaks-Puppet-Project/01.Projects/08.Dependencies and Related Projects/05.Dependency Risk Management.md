# Dependency Risk Management

- **Risk Identification**: Highlight risks associated with dependencies.
- **Contingency Plans**: Develop plans to address these risks.

## Dependency Risk Management in Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Risk Identification

#### Dependency Analysis
- **Internal Task Dependencies**:
  - All tasks are sequential due to solo development (e.g., `CD-T03` PCB Layout must finish before `CD-T04` Fabrication begins).
- **Resource Dependencies**:
  - Single-user constraint: any delays in health, availability, or access to tools directly halts progress.
- **External Dependencies**:
  - PCB fab lead times, component shipping delays, software tool updates, school/lab availability.

#### Identifying Risks
- **Vendor Delays**:
  - PCB manufacturing or electronic part delivery delays could block critical path.
- **Solo Workload Risk**:
  - Overwork or sickness would cause project standstill.
- **Toolchain Breaks**:
  - Unexpected issues in firmware development tools (e.g., compiler crashes, firmware bugs).
- **Academic or Job Conflicts**:
  - School exam weeks or shifts at the bottle manufacturing plant could cause slippage.

#### Risk Severity and Likelihood
| Risk                            | Severity | Likelihood | Priority |
|---------------------------------|----------|------------|----------|
| PCB Fabrication Delay           | High     | Medium     | High     |
| Solo Developer Burnout          | High     | High       | Critical |
| Missed Delivery from Vendors    | Medium   | Medium     | Medium   |
| Academic Schedule Interference  | Medium   | High       | High     |
| Software Tool Failure           | Medium   | Low        | Medium   |

### Contingency Plans

#### Development of Contingency Plans
- **PCB Delay**:
  - Use pre-tested breadboard layout as a fallback; overlap ordering windows with task reviews to minimize downtime.
- **Burnout**:
  - Enforce structured work hours (max 6 hours/day), schedule recovery buffer every 3 tasks.
- **Vendor Issues**:
  - Identify at least two backup vendors per part (e.g., Digikey, Mouser, Amazon).
- **Academic Pressure**:
  - Lock 1-week breaks around known exam blocks.
- **Tool Failure**:
  - Maintain backups of firmware repos and local toolchains on secondary devices.

#### Response Strategies
- **Avoidance**: Prioritize early ordering and validation to prevent delays.
- **Mitigation**: Add 15% buffer to all critical path tasks.
- **Transfer**: Use open-source fallback firmware templates if core logic fails.
- **Acceptance**: Accept low-priority visual design delays if puppet functionality is unaffected.

#### Plan Documentation
- All contingency actions are stored in the `Risk_Log.md` under `/07.Resources and Documents/`.

### Integration with Project Plan

- Risks reflected in the Mermaid Gantt via `crit` markers and staggered buffers.
- Key buffer milestones noted as:
  - `B01`: Post-Schematic Delay Absorption
  - `B02`: Debug Recovery Time
  - `B03`: Academic Week Hold

---

### Communication and Stakeholder Engagement

#### Stakeholder Communication
- Solo project; reports reviewed weekly by creator (Thomas Ware) using structured progress logs.

#### Team Involvement
- Feedback loop created via private Obsidian notes and post-task reflections.

---

### Monitoring and Review

#### Ongoing Monitoring
- Review progress every Sunday evening using `Weekly_Review_Template.md`.
- Log risks encountered and response effectiveness.

#### Plan Review and Adjustment
- Adjust every 4 tasks or upon milestone miss.
- Update `Risk_Log.md` and reference in `Task_Register.md`.

---

### Documentation and Record-Keeping

#### Record-Keeping
- Central files:
  - `Risk_Log.md`
  - `Contingency_Plans.md`
  - `Dependency_Map.mmd`

- All stored in:
  `/02.Areas/How to Setup the Project Guidlines/07.Resources and Documents/`

Effective Dependency Risk Management in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** ensures solo development can proceed smoothly despite uncertainties. Structured responses and buffers built into the timeline increase resilience while maintaining project momentum and well-being.
