# Stakeholder Engagement Across Projects

- **Multi-Project Stakeholders**: Identify and manage stakeholders involved in multiple projects.

---

Effective stakeholder engagement across multiple project streams is essential for the *Control Freaks Puppet Project*, especially since its success depends on the coordination of engineering, creative, and documentation phases. Many stakeholders‚Äîinternal and external‚Äîare involved in more than one area of the project, making their alignment a strategic priority.

## Stakeholder Engagement Across Projects for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Identification of Multi-Project Stakeholders

- **Stakeholder Mapping**:
  - Identify all stakeholders involved in the four major components of the project:
    1. Controller Development
    2. Puppet Development
    3. Show Pipeline Development
    4. Obsidian Vault Integration
  - Examples of multi-project stakeholders may include:
    - Thomas Ware (Lead, Creator, Technical Director)
    - Advisor(s) or Instructor(s) (providing input on both hardware and storytelling)
    - Collaborators from the animatronics or media departments (if applicable)

- **Stakeholder Profiles**:
  - Build stakeholder profiles that include:
    - Involvement level (strategic, technical, advisory)
    - Affected components
    - Influence level and communication preference
    - Expectations for delivery or documentation

---

### Understanding Stakeholder Interests

- **Interests Assessment**:
  - Technical stakeholders (e.g., electrical or firmware advisors) are primarily concerned with reliability, scalability, and documentation of the controller phase.
  - Creative collaborators (e.g., voice artists or storyboarders) are focused on narrative clarity and visual appeal in the puppet and show pipeline phases.
  - Cross-phase stakeholders (like the user themselves) are interested in ensuring that technical development is compatible with content creation timelines.

- **Priority Alignment**:
  - Align project outcomes with stakeholder priorities:
    - Functional prototype ready for demo: high-priority milestone shared across multiple phases.
    - Documentation standardization for reuse or future publication: long-term objective.

---

### Communication Strategy

- **Unified Messaging**:
  - Use the Obsidian Vault as the **source of truth** for all project status and documentation.
  - Implement standardized YAML headers in all vault documents to make tracking, querying, and summarizing updates uniform.

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Send out structured updates to key stakeholders following each weekly review (`Weekly_Review.md`), covering all phases.

---

### Engagement and Involvement

- **Involvement Opportunities**:
  - Allow technical reviewers to comment on firmware design files and test results via GitHub Issues or shared PDFs.
  - Invite creative feedback on puppetry, script, and visuals during the storyboard phase using embedded Obsidian previews.

- **Feedback Mechanisms**:
  - Feedback loops for each phase will be documented in Obsidian:
    - `/Projects/Controller Development/Feedback_Log.md`
    - `/Projects/Puppet Development/Feedback_Log.md`

---

### Coordination Among Project Teams

- **Cross-Project Collaboration**:
  - Given the solo developer context, this involves time-blocked review and integration sessions after each phase to ensure cross-phase consistency.

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - Conflicts between priorities (e.g., controller spec changes affecting puppet articulation) will be logged and resolved using a traceable `Decision_Log.md`.

---

### Monitoring Stakeholder Engagement

- **Engagement Tracking**:
  - Use tags like `#reviewed`, `#pending-feedback`, and `#finalized` in Obsidian to track engagement activity.

- **Adjustment of Strategies**:
  - Adapt the stakeholder communication frequency or format based on feedback or missed expectations (e.g., switching from written notes to visuals for storyboard collaborators).

---

### Documentation and Reporting

- **Record Keeping**:
  - All communications, meeting logs, and decisions are preserved within the `/_Meta/Stakeholders` and `/_Meta/Meetings` folders in the Obsidian vault.

- **Stakeholder Reports**:
  - Monthly project snapshots will be summarized in `Project_Status_Report.md` and tagged by stakeholder relevance.

---

### Review and Adaptation

- **Continuous Improvement**:
  - At each milestone review, evaluate how stakeholder expectations were met and log any misalignments or improvements in `Retrospective.md`.

---

Managing multi-project stakeholders for the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* ensures that expectations are aligned, communication is transparent, and all parts of the project are cohesively moving toward shared objectives. This proactive engagement fosters trust and improves decision-making across the development and creative pipeline.
