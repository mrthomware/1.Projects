# Sequential and Concurrent Activities

- **Analysis**: Determine which tasks are sequential and which are concurrent.
- **Scheduling Impact**: Reflect this in the project timeline.

## Sequential and Concurrent Activities in Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Analysis of Activities

#### Sequential Tasks
- **Identification**:
  - Tasks that must be completed in a strict order due to technical or logical constraints.
- **Confirmed Sequential Activities**:
  - `CD-T01` Define Controller Specifications ‚Üí must precede `CD-T02` Schematic Design.
  - `CD-T02` Schematic Design ‚Üí must precede `CD-T03` PCB Layout.
  - `CD-T04` PCB Fabrication ‚Üí must precede `CD-T06` Controller Assembly.
  - `PD-T03` Install Actuators ‚Üí must precede `PD-T05` Motion Calibration.
  - `SP-T05` Voice Sync Integration ‚Üí must follow `SP-T04` Audio Track Preparation.

#### Concurrent Tasks
- **Identification**:
  - Tasks that can occur simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- **Confirmed Concurrent Activities**:
  - `PD-T01` Puppet Frame Assembly and `CD-T08` Firmware Planning can proceed in parallel.
  - `SP-T01` Storyboarding can occur during `PD-T02` Painting & Detailing.
  - `OV-T02` Asset Documentation can occur alongside `CD-T09` Initial Debugging.

### Impact on Scheduling

#### Integrating Sequential Tasks
- **Timeline Placement**:
  - Tasks are positioned in a strictly linear progression within the Gantt chart.
- **Buffer Time**:
  - Each critical task includes a buffer of 2 days to absorb delays without affecting downstream milestones.

#### Incorporating Concurrent Tasks
- **Overlap Identification**:
  - During `Week 6‚Äì8`, Puppet finishing and Obsidian documentation proceed concurrently.
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Task concurrency is only allowed when team load remains within solo capacity (i.e., documentation while glue dries, etc.).

---

### Resource Dependencies

- **Personnel**:
  - Since the developer is solo, no overlapping tasks require physical presence at the same time.
- **Tools & Equipment**:
  - Bench usage must be alternated‚Äîno concurrent soldering and painting.

---

### Risk Management

- **Risks in Sequential Tasks**:
  - `CD-T04` (PCB fabrication) is time-sensitive. Delay here blocks all downstream integration tasks.
- **Contingency Plans**:
  - Spare prototype boards prepared from earlier test batches as fallback.

---

### Communication and Coordination

- **Team Awareness**:
  - Task tracker board includes visual indicators (üîÅ for concurrent-capable, ‚û°Ô∏è for sequential-only).
- **Coordination Efforts**:
  - Log notes used to remind of task handoffs and transitions, especially when moving from firmware debug to vault documentation.

---

### Monitoring and Adjustment

- **Regular Reviews**:
  - Daily micro-reviews after each development task, recorded in `Daily_Log.md`.
- **Flexibility for Adjustments**:
  - Timeline blocks structured in 2-day increments to permit shuffling as needed.

Proper management of sequential and concurrent tasks in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** ensures the solo developer remains efficient and avoids bottlenecks. This structure also respects personal limitations, avoids burnout, and facilitates traceability and modular completion.
