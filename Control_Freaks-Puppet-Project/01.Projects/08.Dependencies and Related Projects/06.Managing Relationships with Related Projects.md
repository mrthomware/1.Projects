# Managing Relationships with Related Projects

## Managing Relationships with Related Projects for Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Project Portfolio Management

- **Strategic Connections**:
  - The *Control Freaks Puppet Project* is the flagship initiative within the broader *Control Freaks Content Pipeline* portfolio. It directly supports future projects such as:
    - **CF Show Pipeline**: Video production workflows for showcasing puppets.
    - **CF Controller V2**: A long-term project to modularize and miniaturize the servo controller design.
    - **Animatronic Actor Toolkit**: A spinoff project enabling others to use the same puppet infrastructure.

- The current project sets the foundation upon which all other content and product development relies. It‚Äôs the core R&D node in the portfolio.

---

### Shared Resources with Other Projects

- **Coordination**:
  - Shared equipment (e.g., 3D printer, soldering station, multimeter) is also needed in:
    - *Show Pipeline Pre-Production* (prop development).
    - *Educational Series Development* (recording content).

- A shared calendar is required to block exclusive access to tools to avoid bottlenecks.

- Storage and workspace also overlap ‚Äî proper labelling and modular layouts will help avoid mix-ups.

---

### Stakeholder Engagement Across Projects

- **Multi-Project Stakeholders**:
  - *Thomas Ware* functions as the sole developer, stakeholder, and project lead across all linked initiatives.
  - External stakeholders include:
    - UFV instructors (related to coursework integration).
    - YouTube audience expectations (for pilot puppet episodes).
    - Grant providers or sponsors (potentially reviewing portfolio effectiveness).

- Unified reporting and personal dashboarding (Obsidian + PARA Vault + Status Reports) is critical to maintain coherence.

---

### Communication and Collaboration

- **Channels and Meetings**:
  - Internal updates follow a weekly review cycle using the *Control Freaks Vault*‚Äôs weekly template.
  - GitHub issues and Notion cards (if used) allow inter-project tracking of overlapping milestones and dependencies.
  - Key nodes like `Power Module`, `Audio-Sync Library`, or `Frame Assembly` are shared assets ‚Äî collaboration notes need to be maintained.

---

### Integrated Planning

- **Efficiency and Cohesion**:
  - Key milestones are integrated across projects:
    - Puppet Build Completion (must precede storyboarding and camera rig setup in Show Pipeline).
    - Controller Firmware Stable (prerequisite for toolkit documentation and release).
  
- Centralized Gantt chart includes colored swim lanes for each project stream.

---

### Conflict Resolution

- **Strategies**:
  - Preemptive task scheduling: All tasks across projects are serialized due to the solo developer constraint ‚Äî no concurrency.
  - When conflicts arise (e.g., priority on puppet performance vs controller modularity), a decision matrix is used:
    - Highest Weight: *Project Dependencies* (e.g., if puppet can't function, other projects stall).
    - Medium Weight: *Time Sensitivity* (e.g., school deadlines).
    - Lowest Weight: *Innovation Goals* (long-term, nice-to-haves).

---

### Leveraging Synergies

- **Opportunities**:
  - Show Pipeline offers real-world testing and visibility for the Puppet and Controller phases.
  - Controller V2 R&D will reuse debugging insights and designs from the current project.
  - Documentation created here feeds into *Control Freaks Educational Series*, multiplying project value.

---

### Change Management Coordination

- **Impact of Changes**:
  - Changes to servo specs or control schemes cascade through puppet design and video rigging steps.
  - All changes are logged in `/02.Areas/Change Log.md` with tags linking affected documents.
  - Adjustments require updating:
    - Gantt timelines.
    - Task register.
    - Weekly notes.

---

### Reporting and Escalation Procedures

- **Procedures for Multi-Project Issues**:
  - Weekly reviews flag potential conflicts across project streams.
  - Priority is given to the critical path of the Puppet Project.
  - Escalations (e.g., unmet milestones) result in reallocation of task slots and buffer reassignment.

---

Effective management of relationships with related projects ensures the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* remains strategically aligned with the overall vision. It improves execution efficiency, prevents cross-project collisions, and supports long-term scalability of the entire content and product pipeline.
