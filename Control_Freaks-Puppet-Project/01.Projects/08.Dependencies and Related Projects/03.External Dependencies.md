# External Dependencies

- **Identification**: List dependencies outside the project control like vendor deliverables, regulatory approvals.
- **Monitoring**: Establish a process for monitoring these dependencies.

## External Dependencies in Control Freaks Puppet Project

### Identification of External Dependencies

- **Vendor Deliverables**:
  - **Pololu Robotics**: Custom servo motors required for full-range puppet movement.
  - **DFRobot**: USB serial interface boards for debugging embedded controllers.
  - **Filament Supplier**: Specialty filament used for facial skin 3D prints.
  - **VO Contractor**: External collaborator providing synced voice-over audio.

- **Regulatory Approvals**:
  - While not directly regulated, safe battery integration and electrical safety guidelines are followed voluntarily for public demonstrations.

- **Market Conditions**:
  - **Component Pricing Volatility**: Microcontroller and actuator prices fluctuate, possibly impacting cost or availability.
  - **Shipping Delays**: Global supply chain delays may impact servo or sensor module delivery.

- **Other Projects**:
  - **YouTube Episode Schedule**: Puppet debut is tied to the launch of a specific episode.
  - **MakerSpace Equipment Queue**: CNC usage may be impacted by other student projects at UFV.

### Monitoring Process

- **Tracking System**:
  - External dependencies are tracked in `External_Dependencies_Log.md` within the PARA system.
  - Each entry includes: item/vendor, expected delivery, risk level, responsible party, status.

- **Regular Updates**:
  - Vendor status check-ins are scheduled biweekly.
  - Voice-over contributor sends weekly sync drafts and progress updates.

- **Communication with External Parties**:
  - Key vendor emails, invoices, and tracking IDs stored in `Vendor_Contact_Log.md`.
  - Communication with VO contributor managed via shared Notion board + Discord thread.

- **Integration with Project Plan**:
  - All delays or advancements are synced to the Gantt timeline.
  - Status indicators on external items trigger Obsidian task warnings.

---

### Risk Management

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - **High Risk**: Servo motor delay ‚Äî critical path dependency.
  - **Medium Risk**: VO delivery ‚Äî script can continue independently, but final integration blocked.
  - **Low Risk**: Filament supply ‚Äî local backups available.

- **Contingency Planning**:
  - Preloaded backup servo from earlier prototype in stock.
  - Emergency script adjustment possible with placeholder VO.
  - Local sourcing of generic filament if specialty types are delayed.

---

### Stakeholder Involvement

- **Informing Stakeholders**:
  - Project update summary emailed monthly to key collaborators.
  - Delays in delivery automatically flagged in the `Control Freaks Master Log`.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**:
  - VO contributor involved in pacing decisions for sync timing.
  - MakerSpace manager informed of project deadlines to request equipment reservation priority if needed.

---

### Documentation and Record Keeping

- **Documentation**:
  - All external dependencies documented in `04.Support Files/Logs/External_Dependencies_Log.md`.
  - Contracts and purchase receipts stored under `03.Resources/Vendor Contracts`.

- **Compliance Documentation**:
  - Voluntary electrical safety checks logged in `06.Visuals/Safety_Assessment.md`.

---

### Review and Adaptation

- **Regular Review Sessions**:
  - Weekly review of vendor deliverables and impact assessments integrated into Friday task review.

- **Adaptive Planning**:
  - Timeline buffers allow for +5 day vendor delay margin without critical milestone impact.
  - Puppet rig design includes modular insert to allow alternate servo spec fit if required.

Effective management of external dependencies in the **Control Freaks Puppet Project** enables proactive planning, rapid response to changes, and ensures that key deliverables and integrations are not blocked by factors beyond the project's immediate control.
