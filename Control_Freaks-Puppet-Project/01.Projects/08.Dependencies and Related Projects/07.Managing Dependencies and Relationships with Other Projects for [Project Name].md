# Managing Dependencies and Relationships with Other Projects for Control Freaks Puppet Project

---

## Managing Dependencies

### Task Dependencies

- **Types**:
  - Most tasks follow a **Finish-to-Start** model due to the solo developer constraint.
    - Example: PCB Design must finish before Prototyping can begin.
  - No **concurrent** execution is planned.
  - All tasks are serialized across the four project phases (Controller, Puppet, Show Pipeline, Vault Integration).
- **Documentation**:
  - Dependencies are explicitly mapped in the `Master Timeline` Gantt chart and reflected in task IDs (e.g., CD-T01 → CD-T02).

---

### Resource Dependencies

- **Assessment**:
  - All development tools, workspace, and time belong to a single individual.
  - Equipment (e.g., soldering iron, printer, oscilloscope) is used across all tasks.
- **Shared Resources**:
  - Tools and materials like PLA filament, servo motors, and breadboards are shared across:
    - Controller Development
    - Puppet Skeleton Build
    - Puppet Testing
    - Firmware Debugging

---

### External Dependencies

- **Identification**:
  - Delivery of components from external vendors (e.g., AliExpress, DigiKey).
  - Course workload from university studies impacting available dev time.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Component orders logged in the BOM tracker.
  - Weekly notes include time forecasts affected by external obligations.

---

### Sequential and Concurrent Activities

- **Analysis**:
  - All tasks are explicitly **sequential**.
  - No concurrency due to solo development.
- **Scheduling Impact**:
  - This results in longer timelines but reduces risk of task collision.
  - The `Critical Path` document outlines the chain of required completions.

---

### Dependency Risk Management

- **Risk Identification**:
  - High dependency on delivery schedules.
  - Firmware bugs can block progress across all downstream puppet motion tasks.
- **Contingency Plans**:
  - Allow buffer time after PCB production for debug loops.
  - Maintain secondary supplier options for critical parts (like servos or MOSFETs).

## Managing Relationships with Related Projects

### Project Portfolio Management

- **Strategic Connections**:
  - This project is the technical foundation for:
    - The *Control Freaks Show Pipeline*
    - Future educational outreach through the *Toolkit Project*
  - Aligned with the long-term goal of producing entertaining, teachable animatronic content.

---

### Shared Resources with Other Projects

- **Coordination**:
  - Shared access to:
    - 3D printer
    - Camera rig for documentation (shared with Show Pipeline)
    - Code snippets and Obsidian templates for Vault Integration

---

### Stakeholder Engagement Across Projects

- **Multi-Project Stakeholders**:
  - Thomas Ware serves as stakeholder across all projects.
  - Stakeholder updates are centralized via the `Weekly Review` note system.

---

### Communication and Collaboration

- **Channels and Meetings**:
  - Internal tracking through:
    - `Task Register.md`
    - `Weekly_Review_Template.md`
    - GitHub Issues (for firmware and electronics)
  - No external team—so clear self-documentation is critical.

---

### Integrated Planning

- **Efficiency and Cohesion**:
  - All timelines are integrated into a master Mermaid Gantt chart.
  - No duplication of tasks—each project segment contributes upstream or downstream.

---

### Conflict Resolution

- **Strategies**:
  - Task priority matrix in `Project Risk & Prioritization.md`
  - If task conflict arises, favor the **Controller Phase** as it is the gating dependency.

---

### Leveraging Synergies

- **Opportunities**:
  - Controller firmware and schematic designs will be reused in future puppets.
  - Educational materials built during this phase serve as training content for future toolkit users.

---

### Change Management Coordination

- **Impact of Changes**:
  - Firmware structure changes affect puppet range and audio sync timing.
  - Design changes are version-tracked using `Design_Log.md`

---

### Reporting and Escalation Procedures

- **Procedures for Multi-Project Issues**:
  - Escalation occurs via updating:
    - Gantt chart
    - Risk register
    - Project Prioritization notes
  - Project-wide reflection documented weekly in the *Review Note*

---

> **[Dependencies and Related Projects – Note]**  
> Regular review of dependencies, shared resources, and inter-project timelines ensures that the *Control Freaks Puppet Project* remains resilient, adaptable, and effectively aligned with broader strategic outcomes.
