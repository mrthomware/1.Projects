# Managing Dependencies and Relationships with Other Projects for Control Freaks Puppet Project

## Managing Dependencies

### 🔗 Task Dependencies

- **Types Identified**:
  - **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: CAD modeling must finish before PCB layout begins.
  - **Start-to-Start (SS)**: Puppet painting can start at the same time as wiring prep.
  - **Finish-to-Finish (FF)**: Firmware development and audio sync testing must complete together.
- **Documentation**:
  - Dependencies visualized in project Gantt chart (`/01.Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/06.Visuals/Gantt_Timeline.mmd`).

### 🧰 Resource Dependencies

- **Assessment**:
  - Shared use of 3D printer between multiple puppet iterations and controller case design.
  - Limited soldering tools mean sequential board assembly is enforced.
- **Shared Resources**:
  - Shared resource map tracked via vault table (`/02.Areas/Studio Equipment/Shared_Resource_Chart.md`).

### 🌐 External Dependencies

- **Identification**:
  - Delivery of specialty microcontroller boards from Digi-Key.
  - Guest voice actor audio track (external contribution).
- **Monitoring**:
  - Weekly checklist with procurement and collaborator updates.

### 📈 Sequential vs Concurrent Activities

- **Analysis**:
  - Controller development tasks are strictly sequential (solo developer constraint).
  - Puppet finishing tasks (painting, hair) can run concurrently with scene storyboard planning.
- **Scheduling Impact**:
  - Reflected in the timeline: concurrency only used in non-critical, parallel creative work.

### ⚠️ Dependency Risk Management

- **Risk Identification**:
  - Supply chain delays for custom servos.
  - Incomplete documentation from previous prototype version.
- **Contingency Plans**:
  - Use placeholder servos for testing with backup logic.
  - Documented fallback plans in `/03.Resources/Contingency_Plan_v1.md`.

## Managing Relationships with Related Projects

### 🧩 Project Portfolio Management

- **Strategic Connections**:
  - Part of broader *Control Freaks* content ecosystem (YouTube, merch, educational kits).
  - Project aligns with studio mission to blend tech, storytelling, and maker education.

### ♻️ Shared Resources with Other Projects

- **Coordination**:
  - Shared equipment (hot glue station, animatronics controller template).
  - Collaboration across puppet builds tracked in `Shared_Fabrication_Log.md`.

### 👥 Stakeholder Engagement Across Projects

- **Multi-Project Stakeholders**:
  - Artist collaborators also work on website branding and social media graphics.
  - Ensure delivery timelines don’t overlap with other creator requests.

### 📡 Communication and Collaboration

- **Channels and Meetings**:
  - Weekly planning notes in Obsidian shared with all collaborators.
  - GitHub Issues and Discord dev-log used for tech-specific coordination.

### 🧠 Integrated Planning

- **Efficiency and Cohesion**:
  - Master MOC in Obsidian links all phases: controller, puppet, script, and scenes.
  - Dependencies across projects (e.g., firmware changes affecting show flow) mapped in `System_Interlink_Map.md`.

### ⚔️ Conflict Resolution

- **Strategies**:
  - If two tasks compete for same resource (e.g., mic for voiceover vs puppet movement tests), fallback scheduling rules apply.
  - All conflicts reviewed weekly and logged in `Conflict_Log.md`.

### 🚀 Leveraging Synergies

- **Opportunities**:
  - Firmware updates improve puppets across multiple shows.
  - Shared puppet skeleton used in both educational kits and main puppet show.

### 🔄 Change Management Coordination

- **Impact of Changes**:
  - Any timeline shift in controller phase automatically pushes storyboard deadlines.
  - Managed via `Change_Log.md` and updated task links in all notes.

### 🧾 Reporting and Escalation Procedures

- **Procedures for Multi-Project Issues**:
  - Escalation chain defined in `Team_Communication.md`.
  - Major delays reported in monthly summary reports stored in:
    `/01.Projects/Control Freaks Puppet Project/09.Reporting/Monthly_Summary_Reports/`

**Note:** Dependencies and inter-project relationships are reviewed during every major milestone checkpoint and immediately after any scope change or resource disruption. Managing these interactions carefully is critical for sustaining momentum and avoiding bottlenecks.
