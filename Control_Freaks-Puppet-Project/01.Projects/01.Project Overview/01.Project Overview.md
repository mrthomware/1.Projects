# ðŸŽ­ Project Overview â€“ Control Freaks Vault

## 1. Background and Purpose

The Control Freaks Vault is a solo-operated multimedia engineering project integrating **mechatronics**, **creative storytelling**, and **digital publishing**. It merges four distinct development domains:

- **Controller Development**: Custom PCB and firmware for driving multiple servos and audio-syncing motion.
- **Puppet Development**: Mechanical puppet shell with integrated electronics and expressive movement.
- **Show Pipeline Development**: Scripting, cue-sheet design, and media production for character performances.
- **Obsidian Vault Integration**: Structured project documentation and automation using markdown, Dataview, and Templater.

This project leverages open-source hardware/software, low-cost microcontrollers (ESP32/Arduino), and Obsidian for both technical and creative management.

## 2. Project Objectives and Goals

- **Controller Development Goal**:  
  Design, prototype, and validate a stable servo controller board and firmware for sync playback â€“ *Target: September 9, 2025*

- **Puppet Development Goal**:  
  Build and tune an animatronic puppet shell with accurate, programmable jaw/eye movement â€“ *Target: October 22, 2025*

- **Show Pipeline Goal**:  
  Script, cue, perform, and edit a short episode using the puppet â€“ *Target: November 19, 2025*

- **Vault Integration Goal**:  
  Build and document the creative/technical pipeline inside Obsidian PKM system â€“ *Target: December 8, 2025*

| Servo Malfunction            | Spares ordered in advance                   |
| Production Bottlenecks       | One-week buffer per phase                   |
| Solo Developer Fatigue       | Use Obsidian to scope & reflect weekly      |

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- Custom controller board meets timing/latency benchmarks
- Puppet responds to at least 10 scripted motion cues accurately
