# 📜 Scope of Work – Control Freaks Vault

The *Control Freaks Vault* is a solo-developed, cross-disciplinary initiative. This Scope of Work outlines the boundaries, deliverables, and responsibilities across **four interdependent development domains**:

1. 🎛 **Controller Development** – PCB electronics, servo firmware, and sync simulation  
2. 🤖 **Puppet Development** – Mechanical CAD, actuation system, material fabrication  
3. 🎬 **Show Pipeline Development** – Scriptwriting, cue sheet mapping, filming, editing  
4. 🗂️ **Obsidian Vault Integration** – Automation and documentation of all processes
