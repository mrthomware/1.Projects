# 🛡️ Risk Management – Control Freaks Vault

This risk plan addresses potential obstacles across the four key parts of the Control Freaks Vault project:

1. **Controller Development**
2. **Puppet Development**
3. **YouTube Channel Development**
4. **Obsidian Workflow Integration**

---

## 🚨 Potential Risks

### 🎛 Controller Development
1. **Microcontroller Failure or Incompatibility**
   - Custom firmware may not sync audio and motion due to hardware timing limitations.
2. **Timing Jitter in Sync Mechanism**
   - Difficulty in achieving <50ms latency may affect lip-sync accuracy.
3. **Firmware Complexity**
   - Modular codebase might become too complex or buggy for solo debugging within the timeframe.

---

### 🤖 Puppet Development
4. **3D Print or Mechanism Failure**
   - Structural issues in joints, servo mounts, or motion linkage.
5. **Servo Burnout or Misalignment**
   - Risk of component burnout during calibration or high-duty cycles.
6. **Material Sourcing Delays**
   - Foam, silicone, or servo parts may be delayed, stalling fabrication.

---

### 🎬 YouTube Channel Development
7. **Audio/Video Sync Issues**
   - Captured motion may desync in post, especially with frame-rate inconsistencies.
8. **Rendering and Editing Bottlenecks**
   - Existing laptop hardware may struggle with rendering or multi-layer editing.
9. **YouTube Algorithmic Oversight**
   - Pilot episode may underperform due to metadata or engagement issues.

---

### 🗃 Obsidian Workflow Integration
10. **Dataview or Canvas Sync Fails**
    - Misconfigurations may cause lost task references or broken timeline views.
11. **Documentation Overload**
    - Risk of spending excessive time on process capture, slowing development itself.

## 🧯 Mitigation Strategies

### 🎛 Controller Development

- **Strategy**: Develop simulation mockups in Tinkercad and Proteus before hardware trials.
- **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
- **Timeline**: Early Prototyping Phase (June 10–18)

---

### 🤖 Puppet Development

- **Strategy**: Print small mechanical test rigs before full-body puppet. Use known reliable filament and pre-tested servos.
- **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
- **Timeline**: Design & Motion Test Phase (June 25–July 10)

---

### 🎬 YouTube Channel Development

- **Strategy**: Test editing pipeline with sample footage; downscale where needed. Pre-upload metadata optimization.
- **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
- **Timeline**: Week before upload (July 25–Aug 01)

---

### 🗃 Obsidian Workflow Integration

- **Strategy**: Use YAML-first templates, backup vault weekly, and validate all Dataview queries after updates.
- **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
- **Timeline**: Aug 01–Aug 10

## 🔍 Risk Monitoring and Review

| Activity                       | Method                          | Frequency        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Risk Tracking                  | Obsidian vault tasks & reviews   | Weekly           |
| Issue Escalation               | Flags in YAML + Dashboard view   | Immediate        |
| Review Meetings (solo)         | Self-check milestones & logs     | Bi-weekly        |
| Adjustment Log                 | Markdown file `risk_log.md`      | As needed        |

> Risks will be reassessed after each milestone using the Gantt + YAML integrated system.
