# 🧭 Project Governance – Control Freaks Vault

This governance framework defines the structure, roles, and responsibilities for managing the *Control Freaks Vault* solo development project. It is designed to ensure accountability, version-controlled documentation, and adaptability across the **four primary domains**:

1. 🎛 Controller Development  
2. 🤖 Puppet Development  
3. 🎬 YouTube Channel Development  
4. 🗃 Workflow Integration & Documentation

## ⚙️ Governance Processes

### 🔸 Change Control

- Changes to timeline, deliverables, or technical scope are:
  - Logged in `Project_Management/Change_Log.md`
  - Versioned using Git when applicable
  - Linked in daily notes and sprint trackers

- Milestone misses or task delays trigger:
  - Root-cause analysis
  - Timeline adjustment with updated buffer

---

### 🔸 Communication Plan

| Stakeholder         | Frequency       | Method                    | Content Shared                          |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Thomas Ware (Self)  | Daily           | Obsidian Daily Notes      | Task updates, blockers, decision logs   |
| Public Viewers      | Per Milestone   | YouTube, LinkedIn         | Demo, process breakdowns, results       |
| Potential Advisors  | As Needed       | Email, GitHub, Comments   | Feedback prompts, post-pilot contact    |
