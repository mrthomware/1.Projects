# Task: Define Puppet Control System

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T002
- **Description**: Design the full puppet control architecture including selection of control type (wired/wireless), control channels (e.g., servo, audio, lights), power routing, signal logic, and communication interface (e.g., microcontroller, DMX, or custom board). Deliverables include system diagram, component specs, and fail-safe behavior documentation.
- **Assigned To**: Engineering Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-10
- **End Date**: 2025-06-12
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**: 
  - Pending kickoff meeting with mechanical and software leads
  - Initial sketches expected within 48 hours of assignment
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Block diagram and logic planning tools (Lucidchart, draw.io)
  - Microcontroller datasheets (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
  - Access to prior puppet wiring configurations (if available)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Confirmation of puppet motion types and servo models
  - Mechanical design feedback on space allocation
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Balancing complexity vs modularity
  - Ensuring latency is acceptable for performance-grade response
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Core infrastructure for all puppet motion, audio, and interactive effects
  - Foundation for electrical integration, programming, and testing phases
  - Critical to inform component sourcing and budget allocation

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Design must support modular upgrades for future puppet revisions
  - Request from FX Team to isolate audio trigger from servo bus to reduce noise
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Consider backup control layer for manual override in testing/demo scenarios
