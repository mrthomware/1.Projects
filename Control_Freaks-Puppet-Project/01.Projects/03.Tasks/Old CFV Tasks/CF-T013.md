# Task: Puppet Motion Programming & Testing

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T013
- **Description**: Program and test all motion sequences for the puppet, including eye movement, jaw sync, facial expressions, and body articulation. This task focuses on scripting lifelike animations, syncing them with audio tracks, and testing timing, range, and fluidity. Deliverables include a motion library (preset behaviors), calibration notes, and a documented video test log for QA review.
- **Assigned To**: Automation Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-07-04
- **End Date**: 2025-07-10
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Servo ranges from CF-T010 have been logged
  - FX and Creative teams preparing motion script samples
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Motion control board (Arduino/ESP32)
  - Timing analysis software (e.g., FrameView, Serial Plotter)
  - Script editor and simulator
  - Obsidian Vault task logs and QA checklist
- **Dependencies**:
  - Final integration complete (CF-T012)
  - Sound module synchronization (CF-T005)
  - Servo hinge calibration and scripting (CF-T010)
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Matching emotional expression timing with puppet skin feedback
  - Preventing servo stall or overheat during high-speed sequences
  - Ensuring repeatability in multiple environmental conditions
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Directly determines final puppet realism and performance quality
  - Enables reusable scripted motions for live demos and recorded content
  - Forms part of the QA acceptance criteria before public launch

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Creative Lead requests fine control over blink, tilt, and eye dart sequences
  - Consider adding a "random idle behavior" mode for realism in idle state
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Add loop break control for rehearsed demo triggers
  - May test dual-board setup for load balancing during complex routines
