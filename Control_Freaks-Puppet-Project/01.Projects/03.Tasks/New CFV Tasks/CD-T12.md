# Task CD-T12 ‚Äì Upload and Test Basic Motion Routines

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: CD-T12

- **Description**:  
  Upload the firmware developed in CD-T11 and execute initial servo motion routines. This task includes verifying that servos respond to position commands, testing safety limits, and confirming that the puppet‚Äôs mechanical structure handles the motion without obstruction or jitter. Motion scripts will be short, looped sequences to validate timing and power draw under idle and active loads.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-11  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-12

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Flash firmware to microcontroller
  - Run sequential sweep routines for each servo channel
  - Log behavior (jitter, lag, stall) under full extension
  - Identify problematic torque or under-voltage conditions

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Puppet test rig (or dummy servo mount)
  - External power supply with current limiter
  - Serial monitor logging tool
  - Multimeter for voltage measurements

- **Dependencies**:
  - CD-T11 (Firmware uploaded)
  - CD-T09 (Power-on test complete)
  - PD-T11 (Servo calibration, if using puppet skeleton)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Mechanical binding under high torque loads
  - Timing instability if PWM conflicts with serial reads
  - Servo overheat during prolonged test loops

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Confirms hardware-software integration before sync routines
  - Provides early visibility into load behavior and required firmware optimizations

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Consider stress-testing servos using looped cycles at 50% and 100% range
  - Add thermal checks every 2 minutes to avoid burnout

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If load issues arise, pause development and return to PD-T10 for clearances
  - Use hardware PWM only if software servo conflicts occur
