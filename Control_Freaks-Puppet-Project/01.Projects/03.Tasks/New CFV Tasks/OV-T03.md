# Task OV-T03 ‚Äì Create Templates for Firmware Logs and Test Procedures

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: OV-T03

- **Description**:  
  Develop reusable Obsidian note templates for documenting firmware upload logs, testing protocols, bench diagnostics, and system response verifications. These templates should follow the established YAML header and markdown structure for consistency across all test documentation.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-09-19  
- **End Date**: 2025-09-22

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:
  - Draft templates for:
    - Firmware Flash Logs  
    - Bench Test Reports  
    - Servo Response Validation  
    - Audio-Sync Timing Reports
  - Embed YAML headers for Dataview plugin filtering  
  - Use checklists, tables, and log timestamps in markdown  
  - Cross-reference with controller task logs (CD-T10 to CD-T14)

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Obsidian Vault template engine (Templater plugin)  
  - Firmware development notes from Controller Phase  
  - Past test session notes from bench testing

- **Dependencies**:
  - OV-T02 (PARA structure must be in place)  
  - Completion of CD-T13‚ÄìCD-T14 (Bench Integration and Testing)

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Firmware logs must be updated in real time ‚Äî structure must be lightweight  
  - Test formats must support rapid annotation during debugging sessions

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Enables traceable and structured firmware test history  
  - Improves reproducibility of test conditions and debugging sessions  
  - Ensures technical rigor for future audit or reuse

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Ensure templates work for both solo field logs and formal reviews  
  - Template location must be easy to access and modify mid-test

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Template drafts will be peer reviewed by end of controller phase  
  - Future automation: consider YAML snippet insertion macros
