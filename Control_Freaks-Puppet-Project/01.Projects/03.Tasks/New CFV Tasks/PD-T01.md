# Task PD-T01 ‚Äì Draw Puppet Sketches (Orthographic Views)

---

## Task Overview

#### Task ID: PD-T01

- **Description**:  
  Create detailed character design sketches of the puppet in front, side, back, and top orthographic views. These sketches will serve as visual blueprints for the 3D modeling and mechanical layout stages. Key anatomical regions (mouth, jaw, eyes, arms, internal cavities) must be clearly dimensioned for rigging compatibility.

- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware

- **Start Date**: 2025-07-18  
- **End Date**: 2025-07-21

- **Status**: Not Started

- **Progress Details**:  
  - Character pose finalized  
  - Visual direction aligned with Review Point 1  
  - Sketches must be digitally scanned and layered for modeling reference  
  - Annotate dimensions and servo-clearance zones

- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Drawing tablet or paper + scanner  
  - Design brief and reference moodboard  
  - Mechanical constraint notes from controller phase  
  - Drawing software (e.g., Krita, Photoshop)

- **Dependencies**:
  - Completion of Phase 1: CD-T14  
  - Approved puppet concept from Milestone 1

- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Maintaining stylistic consistency across views  
  - Balancing aesthetic appeal with functional geometry

- **Impact on Project**:
  - Forms the visual foundation for CAD modeling  
  - Any inaccuracies or omissions will compound errors downstream  
  - Enables rig planning and servo mounting clearances

---

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Peer review or consultant review recommended before passing to CAD  
  - Incorporate reference points (eyes, chin, pivot) for servo alignment

- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - If scale mismatch occurs during CAD import, align dimension grid in drawing software with Fusion360 unit spacing  
  - Consider sketching servo mounts as overlays for clarity
