# 🧠 8-Bit Computer Capstone Project

A university-level electronics capstone project inspired by Ben Eater’s 8-bit computer architecture. This repository documents the design, planning, construction, and testing of a fully modular, breadboard-based 8-bit computer built entirely from TTL logic chips.

## 📘 Overview

This capstone project focuses on building a functional 8-bit CPU using only basic digital components (74LS series logic chips). It covers:

- **Digital logic design**
- **Computer architecture fundamentals**
- **Breadboard prototyping**
- **Structured documentation and project management**

The design mimics early microprocessor architectures and is intended as an educational tool to reinforce hardware-level understanding of how computers work.

## 🧰 Key Features

- Fully modular 8-bit CPU (Clock, Program Counter, ALU, Registers, RAM, Control Logic)
- Designed using 74LS series TTL logic ICs
- Step-by-step testing methodology
- Visual documentation including Gantt chart and setup files
- Course-relevant documents and project charter
