## Prompt:
Based on the contents of the extracted files, the project appears to be a simple calculator application. Here’s a general outline of the project scope:

### **Project Scope: Simple Calculator Project**

#### **Objective:**

To develop a basic calculator application that can perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application is designed to have a user-friendly interface, accessible through a web browser.

#### **Components:**

1. **Frontend Interface:**

   * **HTML (`index.html`):** Provides the structure of the calculator application, defining the buttons, display screen, and layout of the calculator.
   * **CSS (`styles.css`):** Contains the styling rules that define the appearance of the calculator, including colors, fonts, and layout adjustments.

2. **Backend Logic:**

   * **JavaScript (`script.js`):** Implements the logic of the calculator. This includes handling user input, performing calculations, updating the display with results, and managing the calculator’s state.

3. **Executable File:**

   * **Executable (`calculator_app.exe`):** This appears to be a compiled version of the calculator application, likely intended for standalone use on Windows systems. It may offer the same functionalities as the web version but packaged for desktop use.

#### **Functionalities:**

* **Basic Operations:** The calculator should support the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
* **User Interface:** Users interact with the calculator through a graphical interface where they can input numbers and operations via buttons.
* **Display Results:** The calculator should display the current input and the result of the operations on a screen.
* **Error Handling:** The application should handle basic errors such as division by zero gracefully.

#### **Intended Users:**

This project is aimed at users who need a simple tool to perform basic mathematical calculations. It can be used in both web browsers and as a desktop application.

#### **Constraints:**

* **Usability:** The calculator should be easy to use with a straightforward interface.
* **Compatibility:** The web version should be compatible with modern browsers. The executable version should run on Windows systems without additional software installation.
