## Response:
Eventually, the project moves into the completion phase.

## Prompt:
As the project progresses into the completion phase, the focus shifts from execution to finalizing deliverables, obtaining stakeholder approval, and ensuring a smooth handover. This phase is crucial for formally closing the project, documenting lessons learned, and transitioning any necessary support or maintenance responsibilities.
