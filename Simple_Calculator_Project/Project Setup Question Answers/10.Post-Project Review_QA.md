**6\. Establish Best Practices:**

* **Formalize Best Practices:** Identify repeatable practices that contributed to the project’s success and should be incorporated into future projects.
* **Create Guidelines:** Develop guidelines or checklists based on these best practices to help guide future project teams.

**7\. Compile the Post-Project Review Report:**

* **Summary of Project Outcomes:** Provide a high-level summary of the project’s success in meeting its objectives.
* **Lessons Learned:** Detail the key lessons learned, categorized by successes, challenges, and recommendations.
* **Best Practices:** List the best practices identified and provide guidelines for implementing them in future projects.
* **Action Items:** Document any action items or follow-up tasks identified during the review.
