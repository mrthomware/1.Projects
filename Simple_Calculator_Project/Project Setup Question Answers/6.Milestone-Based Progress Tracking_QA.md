#### **3\. Corrective Actions**

**Issue Identification:**

* **Process:** During each milestone review, identify any issues that could impact the project’s timeline, budget, or quality.
* **Documentation:** Record these issues in an issue log and categorize them by priority.

**Action Planning:**

* **Adjust Resources:** If progress is behind schedule, consider reallocating resources or adding additional support.
* **Schedule Revisions:** If necessary, adjust the project schedule to accommodate delays, with stakeholder approval.
