## Response:
The project enters the execution phase, during which project activities are carried out.

## Prompt:
As the project enters the execution phase, the focus shifts from planning to actively working on the tasks outlined in the project plan. The execution phase is where the actual development, testing, and deployment occur, following the predefined scope, schedule, and resource allocation.

### **Execution Phase: Simple Calculator Project**

---

#### **1\. Kick-Off Meeting**

#### **2\. Task Execution**

**Week 1:**

* **Frontend Development (FE Dev):**

  * Start building the HTML structure (`index.html`) for the calculator interface.
  * Apply CSS styling (`styles.css`) to design the layout, colors, and overall appearance.
  * Ensure that the UI is responsive and works well across different devices.
* **Backend Development (BE Dev):**

  * Begin developing the JavaScript logic (`script.js`) for handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.
  * Integrate frontend and backend components to ensure seamless interaction.
* **UI/UX Design (UI/UX Designer):**

  * Finalize any remaining design details.
  * Provide ongoing feedback to the FE Dev on the implementation of the design.

**Week 2:**

* **Frontend Development (FE Dev):**

  * Complete any remaining UI elements.
  * Refine and optimize the HTML and CSS code.
* **Backend Development (BE Dev):**

  * Finalize the core logic for all arithmetic operations.
  * Implement error handling (e.g., division by zero) and edge cases.
* **Executable Development (FE Dev & BE Dev):**

  * Begin packaging the web application into a standalone executable (`calculator_app.exe`) using Electron or another relevant framework.
* **Quality Assurance (QA):**

  * Start writing test cases for unit testing.
  * Begin initial testing of individual components (UI elements, basic operations).

**Week 3:**

* **Frontend and Backend Finalization:**

  * Conduct final integration of all components.
  * Fix any identified bugs or issues.
* **Executable Finalization:**

  * Ensure the standalone executable is functioning correctly and matches the web version’s behavior.
  * Conduct cross-platform tests to ensure compatibility with different versions of Windows.
* **Quality Assurance (QA):**

  * Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together as intended.
  * Prepare for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by setting up the environment and collecting sample data.

**Week 4:**

* **User Acceptance Testing (QA & PM):**

  * Conduct UAT with a selected group of users.
  * Collect feedback on usability, functionality, and any issues encountered.
  * Address critical feedback and make necessary adjustments to the application.
* **Deployment:**

  * Deploy the web version of the calculator to the chosen hosting platform.
  * Distribute the executable version to intended users via email or file-sharing service.
* **Documentation (Technical Writer):**

  * Finalize the user manual and technical documentation.
  * Ensure all documentation is clear, comprehensive, and user-friendly.

  * What is the plan for today?
  * Are there any blockers?

**Progress Tracking:**

* **Tool:** Use the project management tool (e.g., Trello, Jira) to update task statuses, track progress, and adjust timelines if necessary.
* **Updates:** The Project Manager will monitor progress daily and adjust resources or timelines as needed to keep the project on track.

**Issue Management:**

* **Process:** Any issues or risks identified during the execution phase should be logged in an issue tracker. The team will prioritize and address them promptly.
* **Escalation:** Critical issues that might impact the project timeline or deliverables will be escalated to the Project Manager for immediate action.

#### **4\. Quality Assurance and Testing**

**Testing Protocols:**

* **Unit Testing (Week 2):** Ensure each component works correctly in isolation.
* **Integration Testing (Week 3):** Verify that all components work together without issues.
* **User Acceptance Testing (Week 4):** Validate the entire application with end users to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.

**Reporting:**

* QA will generate testing reports detailing the results of each testing phase, including any bugs or issues found and their resolutions.
