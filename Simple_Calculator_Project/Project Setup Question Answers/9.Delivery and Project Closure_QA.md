### **Summary**

The delivery and closure phase of the Simple Calculator Project ensures that all project deliverables are handed over to the stakeholders, that the project is formally closed, and that all contractual and financial obligations are fulfilled. This phase includes obtaining final acceptance, conducting a thorough review of the project’s successes and challenges, and documenting lessons learned for future reference. The project is then evaluated post-completion to ensure it continues to deliver value to the users.

By following these steps, the project is not only successfully completed but also provides insights and data that can benefit future projects. Let me know if you need additional details or have any questions!
