In project management, defining tasks is a fundamental step in planning and executing a project. Tasks are the specific activities that need to be completed to achieve the project's goals. Here's what to consider when outlining tasks:

1. **Task Description**: Provide a clear, concise description of each task. It should be specific enough that team members understand what is required.

2. **Task Owner**: Assign a responsible individual for each task. This person is accountable for the completion of the task.

3. **Dependencies**: Identify any dependencies between tasks. Some tasks may need others to be completed before they can start.

4. **Duration**: Estimate how long each task will take to complete. This helps in scheduling and resource allocation.

5. **Start and End Dates**: Based on the duration and dependencies, determine the start and end dates for each task.

6. **Resources Required**: List the resources (such as personnel, equipment, materials) needed to complete each task.

7. **Priority Level**: Assign a priority level to each task. This helps in focusing on the most critical tasks, especially when resources are limited or there are conflicting demands.

8. **Progress Indicators**: Define how progress on the task will be measured and reported. This could include completion percentages, milestones reached, or deliverables produced.

9. **Risk Factors**: Identify any potential risks or challenges associated with each task and plan for how to mitigate them.

10. **Integration with Overall Project Goals**: Ensure that each task aligns with the overall project objectives and contributes to achieving the project goals.

11. **Flexibility for Adjustments**: Be prepared to adjust tasks as the project progresses, in response to changes in scope, resources, or other factors.

12. **Documentation and Tracking**: Maintain detailed records of tasks, including changes in scope, timelines, or resources, and regularly update the project plan and stakeholders.

By carefully defining and managing tasks, project managers can ensure that the project progresses smoothly towards its objectives, with clear accountability and efficient use of resources.

Certainly! I'll include YAML Front Matter in the template for project tasks. This will be particularly useful if you're using a system like Obsidian or any other tool that supports YAML for metadata management. The Front Matter will help in categorizing and managing these task documents effectively.

Here's the revised template with YAML Front Matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Task [ID or Name]"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # Date of task creation or last update
project: "Project Name"
status: "not started"  # Options: not started, in progress, completed, on hold
priority: "High/Medium/Low"
tags: ["task", "project-specific-tag"]
---

# Task [ID or Name]

## Task Description

- **Task Owner**: [Responsible Individual]
- **Dependencies**: [List any dependent tasks]
- **Duration**: [Estimated duration]
- **Start and End Dates**: [Start Date] - [End Date]
- **Resources Required**: [List of required resources]
- **Priority Level**: [Priority of the task]
- **Progress Indicators**: [How progress is measured and reported]
- **Risk Factors**: [Potential risks and mitigation plans]
- **Integration with Project Goals**: [Relation to project objectives]
- **Flexibility for Adjustments**: [Potential adjustments considerations]
- **Documentation and Tracking**: [Record of changes and status updates]

## Notes/Comments

_Additional notes or comments about the task can be included here._

---
[Tasks - Note]

**Note:** Update the YAML Front Matter and task details regularly to reflect the current status and changes.
```

This template, with the YAML Front Matter, provides a structured and metadata-rich format for documenting tasks in your project. You can adapt the fields in the Front Matter to suit your project's specific needs, such as adding more tags, changing the status options, or including other relevant metadata. This format will assist in organizing and retrieving task-related information efficiently.

3. **Dependencies**: Identify any dependencies between tasks. Some tasks may need others to be completed before they can start.

4. **Duration**: Estimate how long each task will take to complete. This helps in scheduling and resource allocation.

5. **Start and End Dates**: Based on the duration and dependencies, determine the start and end dates for each task.

6. **Resources Required**: List the resources (such as personnel, equipment, materials) needed to complete each task.This detailed task definition template with YAML Front Matter is an excellent way to organize and manage tasks effectively within a project management framework. Including the YAML Front Matter is particularly useful if you're using tools that support this structure, like Obsidian or any other note-taking/project management tools that leverage YAML for metadata.

### Example Task Definition with YAML Front Matter
