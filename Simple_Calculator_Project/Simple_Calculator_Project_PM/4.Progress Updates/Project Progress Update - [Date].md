- **Milestone 2: Functional Prototype Development** - Completed
- **Milestone 3: Beta Release of Web-Based Calculator** - Completed
- **Milestone 4: Desktop Application Development Completion** - Completed
- **Milestone 5: User Documentation Finalization** - In Progress
- **Milestone 6: Final Testing and Quality Assurance** - Pending
- **Milestone 7: Project Launch and Deployment** - Pending

## Completed Tasks

List of tasks completed since the last update.

- **Task 1**: Finalized the desktop application development, ensuring that all core features and offline functionality were implemented.
- **Task 2**: Conducted the initial User Acceptance Testing (UAT) sessions with a selected group of users.
- **Task 3**: Collected and analyzed initial feedback from UAT participants, focusing on usability and functionality issues.

## Upcoming Tasks

Outline of tasks scheduled for the next period.

- **Task 1**: Continue User Acceptance Testing, addressing any identified issues and gathering further feedback.
- **Task 2**: Finalize user documentation based on feedback received during UAT.
- **Task 3**: Prepare for the final testing and quality assurance phase.

## Current Issues and Challenges

- **Issue 1**: Minor usability issues identified during UAT, particularly related to navigation and accessibility. Impact: Potential need for adjustments before final testing.
- **Issue 2**: Ensuring consistent functionality across both web and desktop platforms. Impact: Additional testing required to confirm performance across different environments.

## Mitigation Actions

- **Action for Issue 1**: Prioritize and implement usability improvements based on user feedback during UAT, with a focus on enhancing navigation and accessibility.
- **Action for Issue 2**: Conduct additional cross-platform testing to ensure that both the web and desktop versions meet performance and usability standards.

## Budget Status

- **Current Expenditures**: $127,500
- **Comparison to Budget**: On track. Approximately 85% of the budget has been utilized, with remaining funds allocated for final adjustments and post-launch support.

## Resource Utilization

- **Human Resources**: The project team is fully engaged in UAT and preparing for final testing. Additional resources have been allocated to address usability issues identified during UAT.
- **Equipment**: All necessary testing environments and tools are functioning as expected. No equipment issues have been reported.
- **Materials**: Sufficient materials are available to support the ongoing UAT and upcoming final testing phases.

## Risks and Concerns

- **Risk 1**: Delays in addressing critical feedback during UAT could impact the start of final testing. Potential impact: Delayed project completion.
- **Risk 2**: Cross-platform inconsistencies that might not be fully resolved before the final testing phase. Potential impact: Increased workload during the final testing phase.

## Change Requests

- **Change Request 1**: Adjustments to the user interface based on UAT feedback. Status: Under review and implementation.
- **Change Request 2**: Additional testing protocols for cross-platform performance. Status: Approved and scheduled.

## Stakeholder Feedback

- **Feedback 1**: Positive feedback on the overall functionality and design of the calculator, with users appreciating the intuitive interface.
- **Feedback 2**: Suggestions for improving navigation and accessibility, particularly for users on mobile devices and desktops with different screen resolutions.

## Next Steps and Action Items

- **Next Step 1**: Continue gathering and implementing feedback from UAT sessions.
- **Next Step 2**: Finalize and review user documentation to ensure it reflects the final product.
- **Next Step 3**: Prepare for the transition to the final testing and quality assurance phase, ensuring all necessary adjustments from UAT are in place.

## Questions or Decision Needs

- **Question/Decision 1**: Should additional resources be allocated to accelerate the implementation of UAT feedback?
- **Question/Decision 2**: Is there a need to extend the UAT period if critical issues arise that require more extensive adjustments?
