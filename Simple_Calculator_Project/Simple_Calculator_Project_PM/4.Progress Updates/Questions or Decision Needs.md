Identifying questions or decisions that need to be addressed is crucial for the forward movement and effective management of a project. This process ensures that critical issues are not overlooked and that necessary input or decisions are sought in a timely manner. Here's a template for outlining the questions or decision needs in a project:

### Questions or Decision Needs

#### Key Issues Requiring Input or Decisions
- **Question/Decision 1**:
  - **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the first question or decision that needs to be addressed. This should include the context of the issue and why it is important.
  - **Impact**: Explain the impact of this decision or the consequences of not resolving this question promptly.
  - **Options/Considerations**: If applicable, list the possible options or considerations that should be taken into account when making this decision or answering this question.

- **Question/Decision 2**:
  - **Description**: [Detail the specifics of the second question or decision, including relevant background information.]
  - **Impact**: [Describe how this decision will affect the project and the implications of different outcomes.]
  - **Options/Considerations**: [Present any potential options or factors that should be considered.]

- **Additional Questions/Decisions**: Continue listing other significant questions or decisions that need to be addressed.
  - **Question/Decision 3**: [Description] - [Impact] - [Options/Considerations]
  - **Question/Decision 4**: [Description] - [Impact] - [Options/Considerations]
  - ...

#### Decision-Making Process
- **Responsible Parties**: Identify who is responsible for making each decision or providing input for each question.
- **Consultation Process**: Describe the process for consultation or gathering input on these decisions/questions, including which stakeholders or team members will be involved.

#### Timelines and Urgency
- **Deadlines for Decisions**: Specify the deadlines by which these decisions need to be made or questions need to be resolved.
- **Priority Levels**: Assign priority levels to each item to indicate the urgency and importance of each decision or question.

#### Documentation and Communication
- **Recording Decisions**: Outline how the outcomes of these decisions or answers to these questions will be documented and communicated to the relevant parties.
- **Integration into Project Plan**: Describe how these decisions will be integrated into the ongoing project plan and operations.

#### Feedback Mechanisms
- **Feedback Opportunities**: Provide opportunities for team members and stakeholders to offer feedback or additional insights regarding these decision needs.

By clearly outlining and addressing these key questions and decision needs, the project team can ensure informed decision-making, maintain project momentum, and effectively navigate challenges or uncertainties.

# Questions or Decision Needs

### Key Issues Requiring Input or Decisions

- **Question/Decision 1: Approval for Customization Options**
  - **Description**: The development team has proposed adding customization options, such as theme selection and button layout adjustments, based on user feedback from the UAT phase. The project team needs a decision on whether to proceed with implementing these features, considering the potential impact on the project timeline and budget.
  - **Impact**: Approving this addition could extend the project timeline by approximately two weeks and increase the budget by $5,000. However, it may significantly enhance user satisfaction and product appeal. A delay in making this decision could impact the scheduled final testing and launch phases.
  - **Options/Considerations**: 
    - Option 1: Approve the addition of customization features, accepting the timeline and budget adjustments.
    - Option 2: Defer the customization features to a future update, maintaining the current project schedule and budget.
    - Option 3: Reject the customization request to avoid scope creep and potential delays.

- **Question/Decision 2: Inclusion of History Feature**
  - **Description**: Stakeholders have requested the integration of a history feature that allows users to view and retrieve previous calculations. The project team needs a decision on whether to integrate this feature, as it was not part of the original project scope.
  - **Impact**: Adding the history feature could delay the project by three weeks and increase costs by an estimated $7,500. It could also require reallocating resources, potentially impacting other project deliverables. However, it may add significant value to the product from a usability standpoint.
  - **Options/Considerations**:
    - Option 1: Approve the history feature, extending the timeline and increasing the budget.
    - Option 2: Postpone the integration of the history feature to a future release.
    - Option 3: Reject the history feature to avoid additional costs and delays.

- **Question/Decision 3: Finalization of User Documentation**
  - **Description**: The documentation team is ready to finalize the user documentation. However, they need confirmation on whether to include information about the potential customization and history features if approved. This decision is crucial for completing the documentation on time.
  - **Impact**: Delays in finalizing documentation could impact the projectâ€™s readiness for the final testing phase and product launch. Including or excluding these features in the documentation must be aligned with the final project scope.
  - **Options/Considerations**:
    - Option 1: Proceed with documentation including the new features, assuming they will be approved.
    - Option 2: Finalize documentation without the new features, potentially updating it later if the features are added.

### Decision-Making Process

- **Responsible Parties**:
  - **Customization Options**: Decision to be made by the project sponsor and lead stakeholders.
  - **History Feature**: Decision to be made by the project sponsor, with input from the development team.
  - **User Documentation**: Final decision to be made by the project manager in consultation with the documentation and development teams.

- **Consultation Process**:
  - A meeting will be scheduled with key stakeholders to discuss the potential impacts and benefits of the customization options and history feature. The project manager will present the options and gather feedback before a final decision is made.

### Timelines and Urgency

- **Deadlines for Decisions**:
  - **Customization Options**: Decision required by November 1, 2024.
  - **History Feature**: Decision required by November 3, 2024.
  - **User Documentation**: Decision required by November 5, 2024.

- **Priority Levels**:
  - **Customization Options**: High priority, as it affects the project timeline and user interface development.
  - **History Feature**: Medium priority, with significant impact on scope and timeline.
  - **User Documentation**: High priority, as it is critical for preparing the final product for launch.

### Documentation and Communication

- **Recording Decisions**: All decisions will be documented in the project management system and communicated to the relevant teams through email and project meetings. Any changes to the project scope, timeline, or budget will be reflected in the project plan.
  
- **Integration into Project Plan**: Approved changes will be integrated into the project timeline, and tasks will be updated to reflect the new scope and deadlines.

### Feedback Mechanisms

- **Feedback Opportunities**: Stakeholders and team members are encouraged to provide feedback on these decisions during the consultation meetings and via a dedicated feedback form distributed after the meetings. Additional insights will be considered before finalizing decisions.
