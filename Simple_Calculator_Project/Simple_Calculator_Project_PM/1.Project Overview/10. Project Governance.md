### Project Governance

#### Governance Structure

1. **Steering Committee**:
   - **Roles and Responsibilities**: The Steering Committee provides strategic direction and oversight for the Simple Calculator Project. They are responsible for approving major project decisions, resolving conflicts, ensuring alignment with organizational goals, and monitoring overall progress. The committee also reviews and approves changes to the project scope, budget, and timeline.
   - **Members**:
     - **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)**: Provides technical oversight and ensures alignment with the organization's technology strategy.
     - **Director of Education Programs**: Ensures the project meets educational objectives and aligns with broader educational initiatives.
     - **Senior Financial Officer**: Oversees budget management and financial accountability.
     - **Project Sponsor (ABC Education Foundation Representative)**: Represents the primary sponsor's interests and ensures the project's alignment with sponsor objectives.

2. **Project Manager**:
   - **Role and Responsibilities**: The Project Manager, John Doe, leads the Simple Calculator Project, overseeing planning, execution, and monitoring. He is responsible for resource management, communication with stakeholders, risk management, and ensuring the project stays on track with its goals and deadlines.
   - **Authority Level**: The Project Manager has authority over day-to-day decisions, resource allocation, and issue resolution within the scope defined by the Steering Committee. He escalates major decisions, such as scope changes or budget reallocations, to the Steering Committee for approval.

3. **Project Team**:
   - **Roles and Responsibilities**: 
     - **Lead Developer (Jane Smith)**: Manages the technical development of the web and desktop applications, including coding, testing, and integration.
     - **UI/UX Designer (Michael Lee)**: Designs the user interface, ensuring it meets usability and accessibility standards.
     - **QA Lead (Sarah Johnson)**: Oversees the quality assurance process, including testing and validation to ensure the final product meets all requirements.
     - **Technical Writer (Emily Davis)**: Prepares user documentation, including manuals and guides.
     - **Systems Architect (Tom Wilson)**: Designs the software architecture, ensuring modularity and scalability for future enhancements.
   - **Reporting Structure**: The Project Team reports directly to the Project Manager. Sub-teams, such as the development and design teams, have leads (e.g., Lead Developer, UI/UX Designer) who coordinate their specific tasks and report progress to the Project Manager.

4. **Sponsors**:
   - **Role and Responsibilities**: Sponsors, primarily the ABC Education Foundation and XYZ Technology Partners, provide the necessary funding and resources for the project. They are involved in high-level decision-making, especially regarding budget approvals, major project milestones, and strategic alignment.
   - **Engagement Level**: Sponsors are engaged through quarterly updates, key milestone meetings, and ad-hoc consultations as needed. They receive regular financial and progress reports from the Project Manager.

5. **External Advisors or Consultants**:
   - **Role and Responsibilities**: The project may engage external advisors, particularly for accessibility compliance and legal consultation. These advisors provide specialized expertise to ensure the project meets all legal and regulatory requirements and adheres to best practices in accessibility.
   - **Integration with Team**: External advisors report to the Project Manager and collaborate with relevant team members (e.g., UI/UX Designer, QA Lead) to integrate their recommendations into the project.

6. **Quality Assurance and Compliance**:
   - **Roles and Responsibilities**: The QA Lead (Sarah Johnson) is responsible for ensuring that the project adheres to defined quality standards. This includes conducting regular quality reviews, managing the testing process, and ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.
   - **Review and Audit Processes**: Quality reviews are conducted at key milestones, with formal audits performed at the beta and final release stages. Compliance with accessibility and legal standards is verified through audits conducted by external advisors.

#### Governance Processes
- **Decision-Making Process**: Decisions are made through a collaborative process involving the Project Manager and relevant team leads. For significant issues or changes, decisions are escalated to the Steering Committee. Disputes are resolved by consensus within the Steering Committee, or, if necessary, by the CTO as the final arbiter.
- **Communication Plan**: The governance structure supports regular communication through:
  - **Weekly Project Team Meetings**: For day-to-day operational updates and issue resolution.
  - **Bi-Weekly Steering Committee Updates**: To review progress, discuss risks, and make strategic decisions.
  - **Quarterly Sponsor Meetings**: For high-level reviews of budget, timeline, and alignment with strategic goals.
  - **Ad-Hoc Meetings**: As needed to address urgent issues or decisions.
