### Key Deliverables

#### Deliverable 1: **Web-Based Calculator Application**
- **Description**: Develop a fully functional web-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced scientific functions (trigonometry, logarithms, etc.). The application will be accessible via modern web browsers and will feature a responsive design to ensure usability across different devices.
- **Purpose**: The web-based calculator serves as the primary tool for users, providing a platform-independent solution that can be accessed anywhere with an internet connection. This deliverable is critical to the project's goal of creating an accessible and versatile educational tool.
- **Completion Criteria**: The web-based calculator will be considered complete when it passes all unit tests, user acceptance tests, and is successfully deployed on the production server. Additionally, it must meet performance benchmarks, such as sub-1-second operation for basic functions and full compliance with web accessibility standards.
- **Responsible Parties**: The web development team, led by the front-end and back-end developers, will be responsible for this deliverable. The project manager will oversee progress and ensure timelines are met.
- **Due Date**: The web-based calculator is scheduled for completion by the end of the fifth month of the project timeline, with the beta version available by the end of the fourth month.

#### Deliverable 2: **Desktop Calculator Application**
- **Description**: Develop a desktop version of the calculator that offers the same functionality as the web-based version, optimized for use on Windows and macOS operating systems. The desktop application will include an installer, user interface adaptations for desktop environments, and offline functionality.
- **Purpose**: The desktop version is intended to provide users with a standalone tool that can be used without internet access, ensuring that the calculator is available in a wider range of scenarios, including classrooms with limited internet connectivity.
- **Completion Criteria**: The desktop calculator will be considered complete when it passes all compatibility tests, operates smoothly on both Windows and macOS platforms, and meets the same performance benchmarks as the web version. The application should also successfully complete user acceptance testing and meet packaging requirements for distribution.
- **Responsible Parties**: The desktop development team, in collaboration with the UI/UX design team, will be responsible for this deliverable. The project manager will monitor progress and coordinate testing.
- **Due Date**: The desktop calculator is expected to be completed by the end of the sixth month, with an initial release candidate ready by the end of the fifth month.

#### Deliverable 3: **User Documentation**
- **Description**: Create comprehensive user documentation that includes a user manual, quick start guide, and a set of FAQs. The documentation will cover all features of the calculator, providing step-by-step instructions for both basic and advanced users.
- **Purpose**: User documentation is essential to ensure that all users can fully utilize the calculatorâ€™s capabilities. It also serves as a support tool for troubleshooting and enhances the overall user experience.
- **Completion Criteria**: The user documentation will be considered complete when it covers all features of the calculator, is reviewed by the QA team for accuracy, and is tested with a sample group of users for clarity and usability. It should be available in both web and PDF formats.
- **Responsible Parties**: The technical writing team, with input from the development and design teams, will be responsible for this deliverable. The documentation lead will ensure that the content is accurate and user-friendly.
- **Due Date**: The user documentation is scheduled for completion by the end of the fifth month, in alignment with the beta release of the web and desktop applications.

#### Deliverable 4: **Modular Codebase for Future Hardware Integration**
- **Description**: Develop a modular and well-documented codebase that is prepared for future integration into a hardware calculator. The codebase should be adaptable, with clear documentation and modular components that can be easily transferred to a hardware platform.
- **Purpose**: This deliverable sets the foundation for the future development of a hardware version of the calculator, ensuring that the transition from software to hardware is as smooth as possible. It supports the long-term vision of the project.
- **Completion Criteria**: The codebase will be considered complete when it meets modularity and documentation standards, passes a preliminary hardware integration test, and is reviewed by the development team for adaptability. The documentation should include guidelines for hardware integration.
- **Responsible Parties**: The software architecture team, with support from the development team, will be responsible for this deliverable. The project manager will oversee the documentation process and ensure that all standards are met.
- **Due Date**: The modular codebase is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth month, with documentation finalized in the fifth month.
