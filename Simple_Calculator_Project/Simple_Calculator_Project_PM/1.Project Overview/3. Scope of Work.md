### Scope of Work

#### Inclusions
- **Project Deliverables**: 
  - A fully functional calculator application that operates on both web and desktop platforms.
  - A user-friendly interface designed for both basic and advanced users, with a consistent experience across platforms.
  - Comprehensive documentation, including user manuals, technical guides, and development documentation.
  - A modular codebase prepared for future hardware integration.

- **Services Provided**:
  - Development of the web and desktop versions of the calculator.
  - UI/UX design services to create an intuitive and accessible interface.
  - Testing services, including unit testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing.
  - Training sessions for end-users on how to utilize the calculator effectively.
  - Ongoing support during the deployment phase and initial post-launch period.

- **Project Activities**:
  - Requirements gathering and analysis to ensure the application meets user needs.
  - Design and development of the calculator's core functionality and user interface.
  - Integration of advanced features, such as scientific calculations and accessibility options.
  - Testing across multiple platforms to ensure consistent performance and usability.
  - Documentation of the development process and final product.

- **Resources Involved**:
  - Development team including front-end and back-end developers, UI/UX designers, and QA testers.
  - Project management tools for task tracking, communication, and documentation.
  - Testing environments for both web and desktop applications.
  - Access to user groups for usability testing and feedback.

- **Stakeholder Participation**:
  - Regular feedback sessions with key stakeholders, including educational institutions and students.
  - Collaboration with the design team to ensure the interface meets accessibility standards.
  - Involvement of the development team in the modular codebase design to facilitate future hardware integration.

- **Timeframe**:
  - The project will commence on [Start Date] and is expected to conclude by [End Date].
  - Key milestones include the completion of the functional prototype by [Prototype Date], beta testing by [Beta Testing Date], and final release by [Release Date].

#### Exclusions
- **Non-Included Deliverables**:
  - Development of a mobile version of the calculator is not included in the current scope but may be considered in future projects.
  - Any hardware-related deliverables will not be part of this phase of the project.

- **Out-of-Scope Services**:
  - Post-launch support beyond the initial three-month period will not be included but can be negotiated separately.
  - Any third-party integration, such as with existing educational platforms, is outside the current scope.

- **Limitations on Activities**:
  - The project will not include extensive customization options for the calculator; the focus will be on a standard set of features.
  - No additional language translations beyond English will be included in this phase.

- **Resource Constraints**:
  - The project will not utilize any external consultants or contractors; all work will be done in-house.
  - Certain advanced technologies, like AI-based features, are excluded due to time and budget constraints.

- **Stakeholder Limitations**:
  - Feedback will primarily be sought from the identified user groups; broader public consultation is not within the project scope.
  - Stakeholder involvement will be limited to predefined project review points to maintain project timelines.

- **Timeframe Boundaries**:
  - Any new feature requests or changes after the initial requirements phase will be considered out-of-scope and subject to additional review and approval.
