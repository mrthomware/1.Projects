# 3. Scope of Work

- **Inclusions**: [Define what will be included in the project]
- **Exclusions**: [Specify what will not be included, to prevent scope creep]

---
A well-defined Scope of Work (SOW) is crucial for the success of a project as it clearly delineates what will and will not be included. This clarity helps in managing expectations and preventing scope creep. Here's a template for outlining the Scope of Work:

### Scope of Work

#### Inclusions
- **Project Deliverables**: List and describe the specific deliverables that the project will produce. Include physical products, reports, software, etc.
- **Services Provided**: Detail any services that will be part of the project, such as consulting, design, development, training, support, etc.
- **Project Activities**: Outline the key activities or tasks that will be carried out to achieve the project objectives. This could include research, design, implementation, testing, etc.
- **Resources Involved**: Specify the resources that will be utilized in the project, including human resources, technology, materials, and facilities.
- **Stakeholder Participation**: Identify the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the project. Clarify who will be involved and in what capacity.
- **Timeframe**: Define the timeline for the project, including start and end dates, and key milestones.

#### Exclusions
- **Non-Included Deliverables**: Clearly state what deliverables are not part of the project. This helps in setting boundaries and managing expectations.
- **Out-of-Scope Services**: Identify any services that are related to the project's domain but are not included in the scope of this project.
- **Limitations on Activities**: Specify any activities that will not be performed as part of the project. This can include certain types of analysis, testing, or development work.
- **Resource Constraints**: Note any resources that will not be available or used in this project, such as specific technologies, tools, or personnel.
- **Stakeholder Limitations**: Mention any limitations regarding stakeholder involvement or areas where stakeholder input will not be sought or utilized.
- **Timeframe Boundaries**: Clarify any time-related constraints or periods that are outside the projectâ€™s timeline.

By clearly defining what is included and excluded in the project, the Scope of Work helps to establish clear boundaries and expectations, which is essential for effective project management and communication with stakeholders.

  - Testing environments for both web and desktop applications.
  - Access to user groups for usability testing and feedback.

- **Stakeholder Participation**:
  - Regular feedback sessions with key stakeholders, including educational institutions and students.
  - Collaboration with the design team to ensure the interface meets accessibility standards.
  - Involvement of the development team in the modular codebase design to facilitate future hardware integration.

- **Timeframe**:
  - The project will commence on [Start Date] and is expected to conclude by [End Date].
  - Key milestones include the completion of the functional prototype by [Prototype Date], beta testing by [Beta Testing Date], and final release by [Release Date].

#### Exclusions
- **Non-Included Deliverables**:
  - Development of a mobile version of the calculator is not included in the current scope but may be considered in future projects.
  - Any hardware-related deliverables will not be part of this phase of the project.

- **Out-of-Scope Services**:
  - Post-launch support beyond the initial three-month period will not be included but can be negotiated separately.
  - Any third-party integration, such as with existing educational platforms, is outside the current scope.

- **Limitations on Activities**:
  - The project will not include extensive customization options for the calculator; the focus will be on a standard set of features.
  - No additional language translations beyond English will be included in this phase.

- **Resource Constraints**:
  - The project will not utilize any external consultants or contractors; all work will be done in-house.
  - Certain advanced technologies, like AI-based features, are excluded due to time and budget constraints.

- **Stakeholder Limitations**:
  - Feedback will primarily be sought from the identified user groups; broader public consultation is not within the project scope.
  - Stakeholder involvement will be limited to predefined project review points to maintain project timelines.

- **Timeframe Boundaries**:
  - Any new feature requests or changes after the initial requirements phase will be considered out-of-scope and subject to additional review and approval.
