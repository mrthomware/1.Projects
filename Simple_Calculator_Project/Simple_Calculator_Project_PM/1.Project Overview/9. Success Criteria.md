Let's apply the context of the Simple Calculator Project to the "Success Criteria" template.

---

### Success Criteria

#### Criteria 1: **Functionality and Performance of the Calculator**
- **Description**: The calculator must perform all intended functions (basic arithmetic, scientific calculations, etc.) without errors and within an acceptable response time (sub-1-second for basic operations).
- **Measurement Method**: Functionality will be measured through extensive unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Performance will be evaluated using automated performance testing tools.
- **Target**: Achieve a 99% pass rate in all functional tests, with performance metrics meeting or exceeding the sub-1-second operation target for basic calculations.

#### Criteria 2: **User Satisfaction and Usability**
- **Description**: The user interface must be intuitive, easy to navigate, and meet accessibility standards. The overall user satisfaction score should reflect positive feedback from a diverse group of users, including students and educators.
- **Measurement Method**: Usability will be assessed through surveys and feedback forms after beta testing. The System Usability Scale (SUS) will be used to quantify user satisfaction.
- **Target**: Achieve an SUS score of 85 or higher, indicating a high level of usability and user satisfaction.

#### Criteria 3: **On-Time and On-Budget Delivery**
- **Description**: The project must be completed within the allocated budget of $150,000 and within the agreed-upon timeline, with all key milestones met.
- **Measurement Method**: Budget adherence will be tracked using financial management tools, and timeline adherence will be monitored through project management software, with regular status updates.
- **Target**: Deliver the final product by February 15, 2025, without exceeding the total budget of $150,000.

#### Criteria 4: **Compliance with Accessibility Standards**
- **Description**: The calculator must comply with relevant web and desktop accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by individuals with disabilities.
- **Measurement Method**: Compliance will be verified through accessibility audits and testing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Target**: Achieve full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and equivalent desktop accessibility standards.

#### Criteria 5: **Scalability and Future-Proofing**
- **Description**: The codebase should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future development, including potential hardware integration.
- **Measurement Method**: Scalability will be evaluated through code reviews and the successful completion of a preliminary hardware integration test.
- **Target**: Code reviews should indicate that the software architecture is modular, and the hardware integration test should be passed without significant issues.

#### Continuous Evaluation
- **Review Points**: Success criteria will be evaluated at the completion of each major milestone (prototype completion, beta release, final release) and during post-launch reviews.
- **Adjustment Plans**: If any success criteria are not being met, the project team will conduct a root cause analysis and implement corrective actions to bring the project back on track.
