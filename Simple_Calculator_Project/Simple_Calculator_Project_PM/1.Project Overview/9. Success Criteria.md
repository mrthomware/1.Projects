## 9. Success Criteria

- **Criteria 1**: [How success will be measured]
- **Criteria 2**: [Another criterion for measuring success]
- ...

Defining clear success criteria is vital for evaluating the effectiveness and overall success of a project. These criteria should be specific, measurable, and aligned with the project's objectives. Here's a template for outlining the Success Criteria of a project:

### Success Criteria

#### Criteria 1
- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of the first criterion for measuring success. This could be related to project deliverables, performance metrics, or specific objectives.
- **Measurement Method**: Explain how this criterion will be measured or evaluated. This might involve quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, or specific performance indicators.
- **Target**: Set a specific target or benchmark that signifies success for this criterion.

#### Criteria 2
- **Description**: [Outline the second criterion, focusing on another key aspect of project success.]
- **Measurement Method**: [Describe how this success criterion will be measured, detailing the tools, methods, or metrics to be used.]
- **Target**: [Establish a clear target or standard for this criterion to be considered successfully met.]

#### Additional Criteria
- **Criteria 3, 4, ...**: [Continue listing additional success criteria, each with a clear description, measurement method, and target.]
- **Balanced Scorecard**: If applicable, incorporate a balanced scorecard approach that includes financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and growth perspectives.

#### Continuous Evaluation
- **Review Points**: Specify when and how often the success criteria will be evaluated during the project lifecycle.
- **Adjustment Plans**: Detail the process for making adjustments if the project is not meeting its success criteria.

By establishing and regularly evaluating against these success criteria, the project team can ensure they are on track to achieve the project's objectives and can make informed decisions about any necessary course corrections.

# Success Criteria

#### Criteria 1: **Functionality and Performance of the Calculator**
- **Description**: The calculator must perform all intended functions (basic arithmetic, scientific calculations, etc.) without errors and within an acceptable response time (sub-1-second for basic operations).
- **Measurement Method**: Functionality will be measured through extensive unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Performance will be evaluated using automated performance testing tools.
- **Target**: Achieve a 99% pass rate in all functional tests, with performance metrics meeting or exceeding the sub-1-second operation target for basic calculations.

#### Criteria 2: **User Satisfaction and Usability**
- **Description**: The user interface must be intuitive, easy to navigate, and meet accessibility standards. The overall user satisfaction score should reflect positive feedback from a diverse group of users, including students and educators.
- **Measurement Method**: Usability will be assessed through surveys and feedback forms after beta testing. The System Usability Scale (SUS) will be used to quantify user satisfaction.
- **Target**: Achieve an SUS score of 85 or higher, indicating a high level of usability and user satisfaction.

#### Criteria 3: **On-Time and On-Budget Delivery**
- **Description**: The project must be completed within the allocated budget of $150,000 and within the agreed-upon timeline, with all key milestones met.
- **Measurement Method**: Budget adherence will be tracked using financial management tools, and timeline adherence will be monitored through project management software, with regular status updates.
- **Target**: Deliver the final product by February 15, 2025, without exceeding the total budget of $150,000.

#### Criteria 4: **Compliance with Accessibility Standards**
- **Description**: The calculator must comply with relevant web and desktop accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by individuals with disabilities.
- **Measurement Method**: Compliance will be verified through accessibility audits and testing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Target**: Achieve full compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and equivalent desktop accessibility standards.

#### Criteria 5: **Scalability and Future-Proofing**
- **Description**: The codebase should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future development, including potential hardware integration.
- **Measurement Method**: Scalability will be evaluated through code reviews and the successful completion of a preliminary hardware integration test.
- **Target**: Code reviews should indicate that the software architecture is modular, and the hardware integration test should be passed without significant issues.

#### Continuous Evaluation
- **Review Points**: Success criteria will be evaluated at the completion of each major milestone (prototype completion, beta release, final release) and during post-launch reviews.
- **Adjustment Plans**: If any success criteria are not being met, the project team will conduct a root cause analysis and implement corrective actions to bring the project back on track.
