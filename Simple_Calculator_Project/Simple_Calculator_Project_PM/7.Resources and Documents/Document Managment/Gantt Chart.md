## Gantt Chart for Simple Calculator Project

### Overview
- **Purpose**: The Gantt Chart for the Simple Calculator Project provides a clear visual representation of the project’s timeline, highlighting how tasks are scheduled over time, their durations, and interdependencies. This tool is essential for ensuring that all team members and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project’s schedule.

### Components of the Gantt Chart
- **Tasks**: 
  - **Project Initiation**: Tasks include securing project approval, identifying stakeholders, and developing the initial project plan.
  - **Requirements Gathering**: Tasks such as conducting stakeholder interviews, documenting requirements, and validating requirements.
  - **Design**: Tasks include creating UI/UX mockups, developing system architecture, and finalizing technical specifications.
  - **Development**: This phase involves setting up the development environment, coding core functionalities, and performing unit testing.
  - **Testing**: Includes developing test cases, performing system testing, conducting user acceptance testing (UAT), and resolving identified issues.
  - **Deployment**: Final tasks involve deploying the application to the production environment, conducting user training, and delivering documentation.
  - **Project Closure**: Tasks include finalizing documentation, conducting a post-implementation review, and archiving project records.

- **Duration**: 
  - **Project Initiation**: 2 weeks
  - **Requirements Gathering**: 3 weeks
  - **Design**: 4 weeks
  - **Development**: 6 weeks
  - **Testing**: 4 weeks
  - **Deployment**: 2 weeks
  - **Project Closure**: 1 week

- **Start and End Dates**:
  - For example, **Project Initiation** might start on **September 1st, 2024** and end on **September 14th, 2024**. Specific dates will be determined based on the project schedule.

- **Dependencies**:
  - **Requirements Gathering** must be completed before **Design** can begin.
  - **Design** must be finalized before **Development** starts.
  - **Development** needs to be completed before **Testing** can commence.
  - **Testing** must be completed before the project can proceed to **Deployment**.
  - **Deployment** must be completed before the **Project Closure** phase.

### Visual Representation
- **Timeline**: The timeline runs from the project start date (e.g., September 1st, 2024) to the expected project completion date (e.g., December 31st, 2024). It is divided into weeks or days to show the duration of each task.
- **Bars**: Each task is represented by a horizontal bar that spans the duration of the task. These bars show how long each task is expected to take and when it is scheduled to occur.
- **Overlap and Parallel Tasks**: For example, certain **Design** tasks might overlap with the early stages of **Development** to ensure that the project remains on track.

### Integration with Project Plan
- **Alignment with WBS**: Each task on the Gantt Chart aligns with the tasks and deliverables outlined in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) of the project.
- **Resource Allocation**: Each task bar can also show which team members or resources are assigned, providing a visual overview of resource distribution across the project timeline.

### Progress Tracking
- **Updating Mechanism**: The Gantt Chart will be updated weekly to reflect the actual progress versus the planned progress. Any delays or changes in task duration will be adjusted on the chart.
- **Milestones**: Key milestones, such as the completion of the **Design** phase or the **Launch** of the calculator, will be marked on the Gantt Chart to indicate significant achievements in the project.

### Usage
- **Project Management Tool**: The Gantt Chart will be used by the project manager and team leads for planning, coordinating tasks, and tracking progress throughout the project.
- **Communication with Stakeholders**: The Gantt Chart will be presented in project meetings and status updates to stakeholders, providing a visual representation of the project’s progress and any potential timeline adjustments.
