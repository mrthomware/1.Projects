### Change Management Process
- **Request Process**: 
  - **Submission**: Any team member or stakeholder can request a change by submitting a Change Request Form (CRF) to the project manager. The CRF must include a detailed explanation of the proposed change and its justification.
  - **Review Process**: The project manager will initially review the request to ensure it is complete and aligned with the project’s strategic goals before forwarding it to the Change Control Board (CCB) for evaluation.

- **Evaluation and Approval**: 
  - **Review Committee**: The Change Control Board (CCB), comprising the project manager, key team leads, and the project sponsor, will evaluate each change request.
  - **Criteria for Approval**: The CCB will assess the request based on its impact on the project scope, budget, timeline, and risks. Only changes that are beneficial or necessary for the project's success will be approved.

- **Implementation**: 
  - **Plan Adjustment**: Once a change is approved, the project plan, schedule, and resource allocation will be updated accordingly. The project manager will ensure that all relevant documents are revised and that the team is informed of the changes.
  - **Communication**: The implementation plan will include a communication strategy to ensure that all team members and stakeholders understand the change and their role in executing it.

### Communication of Changes
- **Internal Communication**: 
  - **Team Briefings**: Changes will be communicated to the project team through regular briefings and updates in the project management tool. Critical changes will be discussed in team meetings to ensure clarity and address any concerns.
  - **Documentation**: All changes will be documented and made accessible to the team, ensuring transparency and alignment.

- **Stakeholder Notification**:

  - **Regular Updates**: Stakeholders will receive regular updates on the project's progress and any approved changes to maintain trust and engagement.

### Regular Review and Auditing
- **Review Schedule**: The Change Log will be reviewed on a bi-weekly basis by the project manager to ensure all changes are properly documented and managed.
- **Audit Process**: An audit of the Change Management Documentation will be conducted at key project milestones or phases to ensure compliance with the established process and to identify areas for improvement.
