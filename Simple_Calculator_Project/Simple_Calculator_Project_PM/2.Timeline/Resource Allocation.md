Resource allocation is a fundamental aspect of project management, ensuring that each task or activity has the necessary resources for successful completion. Here's a template for outlining the resource allocation for each task in a project:

### Resource Allocation Summary

| Task ID | Resources Allocated                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1       | [Detail resources for Task 1]        |
| 2       | [List resources for Task 2]          |
| 3       | [Specify resources for Task 3]       |
| ...     | ...                                  |

#### Resource Details Examples:
- **Task 1 Resources**: Could include specific team members, equipment, software, budget allocation, etc.
- **Task 2 Resources**: Might involve specialized personnel, external consultants, specific materials, or technology.
- **Task 3 Resources**: Could be related to facility usage, travel requirements, or additional funding.

#### Additional Information:
- **Human Resources**: Include specific team members, roles, or external personnel assigned to the task.
- **Material Resources**: List any physical materials, equipment, or supplies required for the task.
