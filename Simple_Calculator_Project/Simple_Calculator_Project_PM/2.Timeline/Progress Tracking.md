Let's apply the concept of progress tracking to the Simple Calculator Project, using a combination of status updates and a progress overview table.

### Progress Tracking

#### Progress Methods

- **Progress Bars**: 
  - Visual progress bars will be used within the project management software (e.g., Asana, Trello) to represent the completion status of each task visually. These bars will be updated regularly by team members as they work on their assigned tasks.

- **Status Updates**: 
  - Weekly status updates will be provided during the Monday team meetings. Each team member will report on their assigned tasks, highlighting any progress made, challenges faced, or changes required.

- **Milestone Checkpoints**: 
  - At each key milestone, a checkpoint review will be conducted to assess overall project progress and ensure alignment with the project timeline and objectives.

#### Task Status Overview

| Task ID | Task Description                                | Status       | Comments                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Requirements Gathering                          | Completed    | Finalized and approved by all stakeholders. |
| 2       | Prototype Development                           | In Progress  | 60% complete; minor delays due to integration challenges. |
| 3       | Beta Testing                                    | Not Started  | Scheduled to begin after prototype development. |
| 4       | Desktop Application Development                 | Not Started  | Planned to start after Beta Testing is completed. |
| 5       | User Documentation Finalization                 | In Progress  | 30% complete; working on the first draft of the user manual. |
| 6       | Final Testing and Quality Assurance             | Not Started  | Scheduled to begin after Beta Testing. |
| 7       | Project Launch and Deployment                   | Not Started  | Scheduled to begin after Final Testing and QA. |

#### Additional Tracking Elements

- **Percent Complete**: 
  - Each task will have a percentage completion indicator to provide a more detailed view of progress. For example, Prototype Development is currently 60% complete.

- **Deadline Tracking**: 
  - Tasks close to their deadlines will be flagged within the project management tool, allowing the team to focus on completing these tasks on time. Any tasks at risk of delay will be discussed during the weekly meetings.

- **Resource Utilization**: 
  - Resource usage will be tracked against planned allocation, ensuring that resources are being used efficiently and that no task is under- or over-resourced.

#### Review and Reporting

- **Regular Review Meetings**: 
  - Weekly progress review meetings will be held every Monday to discuss the current status of all tasks, review challenges, and adjust plans as needed.

- **Reporting Frequency**: 
  - Progress reports will be generated and distributed to the Steering Committee and sponsors at the end of each month, with more frequent updates provided as necessary, especially if issues arise.

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: 
  - Team members will be encouraged to provide updates and feedback through the project management software, allowing for real-time adjustments and support.

#### Adjustments and Revisions

- **Contingency Plans**: 
  - Contingency plans are in place for tasks that are falling behind schedule, including reallocation of resources or extension of deadlines where necessary.

- **Revision of Plans**: 
  - The project plan will be reviewed and revised as necessary based on the progress tracking data. This may include adjusting timelines, reallocating resources, or redefining tasks to ensure the project remains on track.

By implementing this structured approach to progress tracking, the Simple Calculator Project team will have a clear and up-to-date view of where each task stands, allowing for proactive management and timely adjustments as needed.
