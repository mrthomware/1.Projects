Let's apply the concept of task dependencies to the Simple Calculator Project, using a tabular format for clarity.

### Task Dependencies

#### Tabular Representation

| Dependent Task (X)           | Dependency (Y)      | Description of Dependency                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task 2: Prototype Development**  | Task 1: Requirements Gathering  | Task 2 can start only after Task 1 is completed, as it relies on the finalized requirements. |
| **Task 3: Beta Testing**          | Task 2: Prototype Development  | Task 3 depends on the completion of Task 2, as the prototype must be developed before it can be tested. |
| **Task 4: Final Testing and QA**  | Task 3: Beta Testing           | Task 4 can only begin after Task 3 is complete, as it involves final testing based on beta feedback. |
| **Task 5: Project Launch and Deployment** | Task 4: Final Testing and QA | Task 5 depends on the completion of Task 4, ensuring all issues are resolved before launch. |

#### Graphical Representation
To create a graphical representation, you can use a **Gantt Chart** or a **Network Diagram**. Since I cannot directly create graphics here, you can use project management tools like Microsoft Project, Asana, or Trello to visualize these dependencies:

- **Gantt Chart**: Plot each task along a timeline, showing the duration of each task and arrows indicating dependencies. Task 2’s bar starts only after Task 1’s bar ends, and so on.
- **Network Diagram**: Create nodes for each task, with arrows showing the flow from one task to the next based on the dependencies outlined above.

#### Types of Dependencies in the Project
- **Finish-to-Start (FS)**: This is the primary type of dependency in the Simple Calculator Project:
  - **Task 2** can only start after **Task 1** is completed.
  - **Task 3** can only start after **Task 2** is completed.
  - **Task 4** can only start after **Task 3** is completed.
  - **Task 5** can only start after **Task 4** is completed.

#### Considerations for Managing Dependencies
- **Identifying Critical Path**: The critical path is already outlined in the previous section, which includes these dependencies. Monitoring these dependencies closely will help keep the project on track.
- **Flexibility and Buffer Time**: Buffer times have been incorporated after key tasks like prototype development and beta testing to manage any delays that might affect dependent tasks.
- **Regular Review and Adjustment**: Dependencies should be reviewed during weekly project meetings to ensure that any changes in one task do not adversely impact others.
