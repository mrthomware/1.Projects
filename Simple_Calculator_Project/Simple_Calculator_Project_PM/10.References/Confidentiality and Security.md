## Confidentiality and Security Measures for Simple_Calculator_Project

### Identifying Sensitive Documents
- **Classification of Documents**:
  - **Criteria for Classification**: Sensitive documents in Simple_Calculator_Project include materials containing proprietary information, personal data, financial records, strategic plans, or any data protected under relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
  - **Marking and Labeling**:
    - **Digital Documents**: Use watermarks or metadata tags to mark documents as "Confidential" or "Restricted Access."
    - **Physical Documents**: Label folders and cover sheets with "Confidential" stamps or labels to clearly indicate sensitivity.

### Access Control
- **Restricted Access**:
  - **Authorization Process**: Only project managers and designated team members with a legitimate need should access sensitive documents. Implement a request and approval process for access, including role-based access control (RBAC).
  - **Access Logs**: Maintain logs of who accessed sensitive documents and when, to ensure accountability and traceability.
- **User Authentication**:
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for accessing digital documents, combining passwords with additional security measures like one-time codes or biometric verification.
  - **Password Policies**: Implement strong password policies with regular mandatory updates and prohibit the reuse of old passwords.

### Digital Security Measures
- **Encryption**:
  - **Data at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive documents stored on servers, local drives, or cloud storage using industry-standard encryption methods (e.g., AES-256).
  - **Data in Transit**: Ensure all documents transmitted over the internet are encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols.
- **Secure Storage Solutions**:
  - **Cloud Security**: Utilize cloud storage solutions with robust security certifications (e.g., ISO 27001) and ensure that data is stored in compliance with applicable data protection regulations.
  - **On-Premises Security**: For on-premises storage, use servers with physical security controls, firewalls, and regular security patches.

### Physical Document Security
- **Secure Storage**:
  - **Lock and Key**: Store sensitive physical documents in locked filing cabinets or secure rooms with access limited to authorized personnel.
  - **Controlled Access**: Implement a check-in/check-out system for accessing physical documents to track who has handled them.
- **Document Handling Protocols**:
  - **Copying and Printing**: Restrict the ability to copy or print sensitive documents to authorized personnel only, and use printers with secure release functions.
  - **Disposal**: Shred physical documents that are no longer needed using cross-cut shredders, and ensure proper disposal of shredded material.

### Data Transfer and Sharing
- **Secure Transfer Methods**:
  - **Encrypted Emails**: Use email encryption tools (e.g., PGP, S/MIME) for sending sensitive documents via email.
  - **Secure File Transfer**: Utilize secure file transfer protocols (e.g., SFTP) or platforms with end-to-end encryption for document sharing.
- **Sharing Protocols**:
  - **Verification of Recipients**: Verify the identity of recipients before sharing sensitive documents, especially when sharing outside the organization.
  - **Expiration of Access**: Implement time-limited access to shared documents, ensuring that access is automatically revoked after a set period.

### Regular Security Audits
- **Audit Schedule**:
  - **Frequency**: Conduct security audits quarterly, or more frequently if required by the sensitivity of the project or changes in the security landscape.
  - **Scope**: Audits should cover access control, encryption, physical security, and compliance with data protection laws.
- **Audit Documentation**:
  - **Audit Reports**: Maintain detailed records of each audit, including any identified vulnerabilities and the actions taken to address them. Store audit reports securely and restrict access to authorized personnel.

### Training and Awareness
- **Confidentiality Training**:
  - **Initial Training**: Provide mandatory confidentiality and data protection training to all team members at the start of the project.
  - **Ongoing Training**: Conduct regular refresher training sessions to keep the team informed of best practices and any changes in policies or regulations.
- **Awareness Campaigns**:
  - **Reminders**: Use email campaigns, posters, and digital reminders to reinforce the importance of confidentiality and the correct handling of sensitive information.
