## Version Control System for Simple_Calculator_Project

### Version Control Methods
- **Document Versioning Convention**:
  - **Standard Naming**: Each document will follow a consistent naming convention that includes the document name, version number, and date of the update (e.g., "ProjectPlan_v1_2023-09-15_Draft"). For major revisions, the version number will be incremented (e.g., v2), and for minor edits, subversions will be used (e.g., v1.1).
  - **Revision Status**: Documents will be tagged with their status, such as "Draft," "Final," or "Revised," to clearly communicate their current state.

- **Version History Tracking**:
  - **Automatic Tracking**: Utilize version history features available in cloud storage platforms like Google Drive or SharePoint, which log all changes made to a document, including who made the change and when.
  - **Manual Logs**: For platforms without automatic tracking, maintain a version log within the document itself or in a separate version control log file, noting each update, the date, and the person responsible for the changes.

### Centralized Document Management
- **Central Repository**:
  - **Cloud Storage System**: All project documents will be stored in a centralized cloud-based repository such as Google Drive, SharePoint, or a dedicated Document Management System (DMS) that supports version control.
  - **Project Management Tool Integration**: Documents will also be linked to or stored within the project management tool (e.g., Asana, Trello) to ensure easy access and consistent updates.

- **Access and Editing Control**:
  - **Restricted Editing Rights**: Only authorized personnel (e.g., project managers, document owners) will have editing access to crucial project documents. Other team members may have view-only access unless otherwise specified.
  - **Edit Request System**: If a team member needs to suggest changes, they can request edits through a formal process or use a "comment" feature within the document, which will then be reviewed and implemented by an authorized editor.

### Regular Updates
- **Update Routine**:
  - **Scheduled Reviews**: Documents will be reviewed and updated at predefined intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly) or as significant changes occur in the project.
  - **Ad-hoc Updates**: Additional updates will be made as necessary, particularly in response to new information, feedback, or changes in project scope.

- **Notification System**:
  - **Email Notifications**: Team members will receive automatic notifications via email or within the project management tool whenever a document is updated or a new version is released.
  - **Changelog Announcements**: Major updates will be accompanied by a changelog announcement summarizing the key changes and their implications for the project.

### Archiving Old Versions
- **Archiving Policy**:
  - **Retention Policy**: Old document versions will be archived after a new version is finalized. The retention period for archived versions will be defined (e.g., 2 years post-project completion) before they are permanently deleted, unless required for legal or compliance purposes.
  - **Archived Location**: Archived versions will be stored in a dedicated folder within the document repository, clearly labeled with the document name, version number, and archive date.

- **Retrieval Process**:
  - **Accessing Archives**: Team members can request access to archived versions through the project manager or the document control officer. Archived versions will remain accessible but read-only, ensuring that past versions are preserved without accidental modification.

### Training and Documentation
- **Training for Team Members**:
  - **Version Control Workshops**: All team members will attend workshops on version control practices, covering how to name, update, archive, and retrieve documents.
  - **Ongoing Support**: Refresher training sessions and ongoing support will be available to ensure adherence to version control standards.

- **Documentation of Version Control Procedures**:
  - **Guidelines Document**: A detailed version control procedures document will be created and shared with the team, outlining all version control methods, responsibilities, and best practices.

### Integration with Project Tools
- **Tool Integration**:
  - **Seamless Workflow**: Version control practices will be integrated with project management tools, ensuring that document updates are synchronized across all platforms. For example, when a document is updated in the cloud storage, the project management tool will automatically reflect the new version.

### Auditing and Compliance
- **Regular Audits**:
  - **Compliance Checks**: Regular audits will be conducted to ensure that all documents adhere to the version control procedures. These audits will check for consistency in naming conventions, accuracy of version history, and proper archiving.
  - **Addressing Issues**: Any issues or discrepancies identified during the audit will be addressed promptly, with corrective actions implemented to prevent future occurrences.
