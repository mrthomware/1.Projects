## Accessibility of Reference Materials for Simple_Calculator_Project

### Access Channels
- **Digital Repository Access**:
  - **Primary Platforms**: Reference materials for Simple_Calculator_Project are stored on the organization's cloud storage platform, such as Google Drive or SharePoint. Additionally, project-specific materials are accessible through project management software like Trello or Asana, which also serves as a central hub for document sharing.
  - **Internal Servers**: For highly sensitive documents, an internal server with restricted access is used, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access these files.

- **Physical Document Access** (if applicable):
  - **Storage Location**: Physical documents, if needed, are stored in secure filing cabinets located in the project management office. These cabinets are organized by category and labeled for easy retrieval.
  - **Access Process**: Team members must log their access in a physical sign-out sheet or through a digital check-out system to ensure proper tracking of document usage.

### User Access Levels
- **Defined Access Permissions**:
  - **Access Tiers**: The project team is divided into several access tiers:
    - **Admin Level**: Full access, including the ability to view, edit, and manage all documents (e.g., Project Managers, Administrators).
    - **Editor Level**: Can view and edit documents but cannot delete or manage access (e.g., Team Leads, Key Stakeholders).
    - **Viewer Level**: Can only view documents relevant to their role, without editing rights (e.g., General Team Members).
    - **Restricted Access**: Certain documents are further restricted to a select group of individuals (e.g., Legal Counsel, Financial Advisors).

- **Access Control System**:
  - **System Used**: Access is controlled through a combination of password protection and user authentication, managed by an IT security system. Permissions are reviewed quarterly to ensure they remain appropriate as project roles evolve.

### Remote Access
- **VPN and Remote Access Tools**:
  - **VPN Usage**: Team members can securely access the organization's internal network and sensitive documents remotely via a VPN (Virtual Private Network). This ensures that all data transmissions are encrypted.
  - **Remote Software**: Tools like Citrix or Remote Desktop are available for team members who need to access internal servers or software remotely.

- **Guidelines for Remote Access**:
  - **Security Protocols**: Team members must follow specific security protocols when accessing documents remotely, such as using secure Wi-Fi connections, keeping antivirus software updated, and avoiding the use of public computers.

### Mobile Accessibility
- **Mobile Access Solutions**:
  - **Mobile Platforms**: Reference materials are accessible via mobile devices through apps associated with the cloud storage platform (e.g., Google Drive app, SharePoint app). Project management tools also offer mobile-friendly interfaces, ensuring that team members can access documents on the go.
  - **Usage Guidelines**: Users are encouraged to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on mobile devices to enhance security when accessing sensitive information.

### Training and Support
- **User Training**:
  - **Training Sessions**: Regular training sessions are conducted to familiarize team members with the digital repository, access protocols, and best practices for document management. Training includes both initial onboarding and refresher courses.
  - **User Guides**: Comprehensive user guides and video tutorials are available in the digital repository, providing step-by-step instructions for accessing and managing documents.

- **Support Channels**:
  - **Technical Support**: A dedicated support team is available to assist with any technical issues related to accessing documents. Support can be reached via a helpdesk ticket system or direct contact through email or phone.

### Regular Updates and Notifications
- **Update Alerts**:
  - **Notification System**: Team members receive automatic notifications via email or through the project management software when new documents are added or existing documents are updated. This ensures that everyone is aware of the latest information and can act accordingly.

### Security Measures
- **Data Security Protocols**:
  - **Encryption**: All sensitive documents are encrypted both in transit and at rest. This is managed by the cloud storage provider or internal IT systems.
  - **Secure Logins**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for accessing sensitive documents, adding an additional layer of security.
  - **Regular Audits**: Security audits are conducted regularly to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure that the system remains secure against unauthorized access.
