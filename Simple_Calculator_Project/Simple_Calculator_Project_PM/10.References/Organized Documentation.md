## Organized Documentation for Simple_Calculator_Project

### Filing System Overview
- **System Structure**:
  - The filing system for Simple_Calculator_Project is organized hierarchically, with main categories aligned with the project phases: Planning, Execution, Monitoring, and Closure. Each main category is further divided into subcategories such as Technical Documents, Financial Records, Communication Logs, and Risk Management.

- **Categorization**:
  - Documents are categorized based on their relevance to specific project phases or types. For example, within the Execution phase, documents are categorized into Deliverables, Progress Reports, and Change Requests. This ensures that related documents are grouped together, making it easier to locate specific files.

### Document Naming Conventions
- **Standardized Naming**:
  - A standardized naming convention is used to ensure consistency across all project documents. The format is as follows:
    - **ProjectName_DocumentType_Date_VersionNumber**.
    - Example: `SimpleCalculator_Budget_20230815_v1.docx`.
  - This convention includes the project name, type of document (e.g., Budget, Report, Specification), the date of creation or last update (in YYYYMMDD format), and the version number.

### Storage and Retrieval
- **Storage Locations**:
  - All documents are stored in a centralized digital repository on a cloud-based platform (e.g., Google Drive, SharePoint) that allows for real-time collaboration and access from any location. 
  - Physical copies, where necessary, are stored in a secure, organized filing cabinet with folders labeled according to the same categorization system used in the digital repository.

- **Retrieval Process**:
  - The digital repository includes advanced search functionalities that allow users to locate documents by keyword, category, date, or document type. Filters and tags are also used to streamline the retrieval process, enabling quick access to specific documents.

### Security and Access
- **Access Control**:
  - Access to the digital repository is controlled through role-based permissions. Project managers have full access, while team members have restricted access depending on their role and responsibilities. Sensitive documents, such as financial records and legal contracts, are further restricted to authorized personnel only.
  - Access permissions are managed by the project administrator and are reviewed regularly to ensure appropriate access levels.

- **Confidentiality Protocols**:
  - Confidential documents are encrypted and password-protected. Access logs are maintained to monitor who accesses or modifies these files. For physical documents, sensitive files are stored in a locked cabinet with restricted access to authorized personnel only.

### Version Control
- **Version Management**:
  - A version control system is in place within the digital repository to track changes to documents. Each document is tagged with its version number, and previous versions are archived but remain accessible if needed. 
  - A changelog is maintained within each document, detailing edits, updates, and the name of the team member who made the changes.

### Regular Maintenance
- **Update and Cleanup Routine**:
  - The filing system is reviewed and updated on a monthly basis. This routine includes archiving outdated documents, updating versions, and removing any duplicate or unnecessary files. 
  - An annual audit of the filing system ensures long-term compliance with project management best practices.

### Integration with Communication Tools
- **Link with Communication Channels**:
  - The filing system is integrated with the teamâ€™s communication platform (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack), allowing direct links to documents within messages and discussion threads. This integration facilitates quick reference and reduces the need for repeated file uploads.

### Documentation Best Practices
- **Best Practice Guidelines**:
  - Best practices include creating clear, concise, and well-structured documents, using the standardized naming convention, and ensuring that all documents are properly categorized and filed immediately upon creation. 
  - Regular training sessions are held to keep the team updated on best practices and any changes to the filing system.
