### Selection of Project Management Tools
- **Identify Compatible Tools**:
  - Choose project management tools that support integration with document management systems or repositories. Consider tools like Trello, Asana, Microsoft Teams, or Slack, which allow linking or attaching documents. Ensure the selected tools are compatible with the existing document storage solutions, whether they are cloud-based or on-premise.

### Methods of Integration
- **Direct Linking**:
  - Implement a system where reference materials can be directly linked within project management tools. This includes hyperlinking documents stored in cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) or internal servers, ensuring easy access from within the project management interface.
- **Embedding Documents**:
  - Where feasible, embed documents directly within the project management tool interfaces, allowing team members to view and access documents without needing to leave the platform. This can streamline workflows and reduce the need for switching between multiple applications.
- **Attachment Features**:
  - Utilize the attachment features in project management tools to attach relevant documents to specific tasks, milestones, or discussions. This keeps all necessary information in context and accessible at the point of need.

### Synchronization and Real-Time Updates
- **Automated Synchronization**:
  - Set up automated synchronization between document repositories and project management tools. This ensures that any updates to reference materials are reflected in the project management tool immediately, providing the team with the most current information.
- **Real-Time Update Notifications**:
