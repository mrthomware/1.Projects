### Stakeholder Representatives Roles

#### Responsibilities

- **Voice of Stakeholder Groups**:
  - Stakeholder Representatives act as the primary conduit between the Simple Calculator Project team and various stakeholder groups. They ensure that the perspectives, concerns, and requirements of these groups are accurately conveyed to the project team.
  - Their role is critical in ensuring that the project remains aligned with the needs and expectations of all stakeholders, thereby increasing the likelihood of project success and stakeholder satisfaction.

- **Gathering Input and Feedback**:
  - The Stakeholder Representatives are responsible for actively seeking input and feedback from their respective stakeholder groups. This can involve conducting surveys, organizing focus groups, or facilitating discussions to gather insights on how the project is progressing and how it is being perceived by the stakeholders.
  - They compile and present this feedback to the project team, ensuring that stakeholder opinions are considered in decision-making processes.

- **Requirement Communication**:
  - One of the core responsibilities of the Stakeholder Representatives is to clearly and effectively communicate the specific requirements, expectations, and priorities of their stakeholder groups to the project team.
  - This involves translating stakeholder needs into actionable requirements that the project team can incorporate into the development and implementation phases of the Simple Calculator.

- **Change Communication**:
  - Stakeholder Representatives play a key role in communicating any changes or updates within the project back to their stakeholder groups. This includes informing stakeholders about shifts in project scope, timelines, or objectives, and explaining the reasons behind these changes.
  - Their timely and transparent communication helps to manage expectations and maintain stakeholder trust and support.

- **Feedback Loop Creation**:
  - Creating an effective feedback loop is essential for continuous stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder Representatives facilitate this by ensuring that stakeholder feedback is communicated to the project team and that responses or actions taken based on this feedback are relayed back to the stakeholders.
  - This two-way communication ensures that stakeholders feel heard and valued throughout the project lifecycle.

- **Conflict Resolution**:
  - In cases where there are conflicting interests or differing priorities among various stakeholder groups, Stakeholder Representatives are responsible for mediating these conflicts.
  - They work to find compromises or mutually agreeable solutions that balance the needs of different groups while keeping the project on track.

- **Advisory Role**:
  - Stakeholder Representatives often serve in an advisory capacity to the project team, offering insights and recommendations based on the perspectives and concerns of their stakeholder groups.
  - Their advice is crucial in guiding project decisions that affect or involve their stakeholder groups, ensuring that these decisions are informed and considerate of all stakeholder interests.

- **Engagement and Support**:
  - Maintaining high levels of stakeholder engagement and support is a key responsibility of the Stakeholder Representatives. They address any concerns or issues that may arise among their stakeholder groups, working proactively to resolve these and maintain positive relationships.
  - Their efforts in keeping stakeholders engaged and supportive are vital to the overall success of the project, as stakeholder buy-in is often a determining factor in project outcomes.
