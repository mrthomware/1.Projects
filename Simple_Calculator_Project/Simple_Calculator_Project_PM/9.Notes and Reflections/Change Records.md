### [August 28, 2024]

#### Change Details:
- **Change ID/Name**: CHG001 - Adjustment of Core Logic Development Deadline
- **Description of Change**: 
  - The deadline for the completion of the core logic development has been extended by two weeks due to unforeseen complexity in the coding process.
- **Affected Project Areas**: 
  - Schedule, Resource Allocation, Testing Phase Timeline

#### Reason and Impact:
- **Reason for Change**: 
  - The core logic's complexity was underestimated, requiring additional time to ensure that the calculations and algorithms function correctly and efficiently.
- **Impact Assessment**: 
  - This change will delay the start of the user interface (UI) design phase and potentially push back the overall project timeline. However, this adjustment is necessary to avoid future complications and ensure a stable foundation for the UI.
- **Required Adjustments**: 
  - The project schedule will be updated to reflect the new core logic deadline. Additional resources, such as an extra developer, may be allocated to accelerate progress and mitigate further delays.

### [September 5, 2024]

#### Change Details:
- **Change ID/Name**: CHG002 - Integration of New Third-Party Library for Mathematical Functions
- **Description of Change**: 
  - A decision has been made to switch to a different third-party library for handling advanced mathematical functions after initial testing showed compatibility issues with the originally selected library.
- **Affected Project Areas**: 
  - Scope, Budget, Testing Phase, Technical Requirements

#### Reason and Impact:
- **Reason for Change**: 
  - The original library failed to meet performance expectations during early integration testing, necessitating a switch to a more reliable alternative.
- **Impact Assessment**: 
  - The new library requires additional integration work, which could extend the development timeline slightly. The change will increase the budget marginally due to higher licensing costs, but it is expected to provide a more robust solution.
- **Required Adjustments**: 
  - Update the project budget to account for the increased cost. Extend the integration and testing timeline by one week to accommodate the new library. Technical documentation will need to be revised to reflect the changes.

### [September 12, 2024]

#### Change Details:
- **Change ID/Name**: CHG003 - Addition of User Feedback Loop During UI Development
- **Description of Change**: 
  - A continuous feedback loop has been introduced during the UI development phase to incorporate user input more effectively and make iterative improvements.
- **Affected Project Areas**: 
  - Schedule, Scope, Stakeholder Engagement

#### Reason and Impact:
- **Reason for Change**: 
  - Early user feedback revealed some design flaws that could impact user satisfaction. Integrating a feedback loop allows for adjustments to be made in real-time, improving the final product's quality.
- **Impact Assessment**: 
  - The iterative nature of this approach may extend the UI development timeline but is expected to result in a more user-friendly and well-received final product.
- **Required Adjustments**: 
  - Adjust the project timeline to allow for multiple feedback and revision cycles. Additional meetings with stakeholders will be scheduled to review feedback and make decisions on necessary changes.
