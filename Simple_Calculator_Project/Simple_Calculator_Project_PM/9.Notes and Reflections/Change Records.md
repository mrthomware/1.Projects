### Date of Change: **September 20, 2024**

#### Change Details:
- **Change ID/Name**: CHG-002 - Extension of UAT Phase
- **Description of Change**: 
  - The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase is extended by five days to allow for more thorough testing of the newly added customization features and to address minor bugs identified in the initial round of UAT.
- **Affected Project Areas**: 
  - **Schedule**: The extension of the UAT phase impacts the overall project timeline, pushing the final testing and deployment dates.
  - **Resources**: Additional testing resources are required to complete the extended UAT phase within the new timeline.

#### Reason and Impact:
- **Reason for Change**: 
  - The extension was necessary due to the late addition of customization features and the need to ensure they are thoroughly tested for functionality and user experience.
- **Impact Assessment**: 
  - **Positive Impact**: Extending UAT ensures a higher quality product with fewer bugs at launch, leading to better user satisfaction and fewer post-launch issues.
  - **Negative Impact**: The overall project timeline is delayed, which could affect the planned launch date and potentially incur additional costs for extended resource utilization.
- **Required Adjustments**: 
  - **Timeline Adjustment**: The UAT phase is now scheduled to complete by September 30, 2024, with final testing and deployment adjusted accordingly.
