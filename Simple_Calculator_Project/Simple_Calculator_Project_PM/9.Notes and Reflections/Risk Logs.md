## Risk Log for Simple_Calculator_Project

### [Current Date]

#### New Risks or Changes:

- **Risk 001: Delays in Core Logic Development**:
  - **Description**: The complexity of the core logic has led to delays in development, potentially impacting subsequent tasks like UI design and testing.
  - **Severity Level**: High
  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Delays could lead to a cascading effect, pushing back the entire project timeline and affecting the release date.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: 
    - Increase the development teamâ€™s capacity by reallocating resources from less critical tasks.
    - Implement daily progress checks to identify and resolve bottlenecks quickly.
  
- **Risk 002: Integration Issues with Third-Party Libraries**:
  - **Description**: There may be compatibility issues when integrating third-party libraries required for advanced mathematical functions.
  - **Severity Level**: Medium
  - **Likelihood**: High
  - **Impact**: Integration issues could cause significant delays and may require rework if the libraries do not function as expected.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**: 
    - Conduct early testing of third-party libraries in a sandbox environment.
    - Have backup libraries or alternative solutions available if primary libraries fail.

- **Risk 003: Insufficient UI Design Resources**:
  - **Description**: The UI design team is currently under-resourced, which could delay the completion of the user interface.
  - **Severity Level**: Medium
  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Delays in UI design could lead to a bottleneck in the testing and user experience phases, potentially compromising the overall project timeline.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Hire additional temporary design staff or reassign existing designers from other projects.
    - Prioritize the most critical UI elements to ensure the most important features are completed first.

- **Risk 004: Delayed User Feedback**:
  - **Description**: There is a risk of delayed feedback from stakeholders during the user testing phase, which could slow down the implementation of necessary changes.
  - **Severity Level**: Medium
  - **Likelihood**: Medium
  - **Impact**: Delays in receiving feedback could push back final adjustments and extend the project timeline.
  - **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Establish clear deadlines for feedback and schedule follow-up meetings to ensure timely responses.
    - Provide a structured feedback form to streamline the process.

#### Risk Mitigation Effectiveness:

- **Risk 001: Delays in Core Logic Development**:
  - **Mitigation Actions Taken**: Additional developers have been assigned to the core logic task, and daily check-ins have been implemented.
  - **Effectiveness Assessment**: This has resulted in a slight acceleration in progress, but the risk remains high due to the task's complexity.
  - **Further Actions Required**: Consider implementing pair programming or bringing in a specialist to expedite the more complex components.

- **Risk 002: Integration Issues with Third-Party Libraries**:
  - **Mitigation Actions Taken**: Early testing of the libraries has begun, and a backup library has been identified.
  - **Effectiveness Assessment**: Early testing has revealed some minor issues, but they are being addressed. The backup library is ready if needed.
  - **Further Actions Required**: Continue testing and prepare detailed documentation for the backup plan.

- **Risk 003: Insufficient UI Design Resources**:
  - **Mitigation Actions Taken**: Temporary designers have been hired, and prioritization of UI elements has been enforced.
  - **Effectiveness Assessment**: The additional resources have significantly improved progress, reducing the risk level to medium-low.
  - **Further Actions Required**: Monitor the progress of UI design to ensure it stays on track, and adjust resource allocation as needed.

- **Risk 004: Delayed User Feedback**:
  - **Mitigation Actions Taken**: Structured feedback forms have been distributed, and deadlines for feedback have been clearly communicated to stakeholders.
  - **Effectiveness Assessment**: Initial feedback has been received on time, indicating that the mitigation strategy is effective.
  - **Further Actions Required**: Maintain regular follow-ups to ensure the timely completion of the feedback process.
