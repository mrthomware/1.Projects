INTRODUCTION: TWO WORLDS COLLIDE**\n\n- **Setting**: A quiet, mundane suburban town tucked between the mountains and a forgotten forest.\n    \n- **Protagonists**:\n    \n    - **Glowling (the blue creature)**: A childlike, otherworldly being made of bioluminescent energy. Escaped from a decaying star nursery hidden beyond the moon.\n        \n    - **Mr. Gribble (the orange man)**: A bitter, retired toy inventor who lives alone in a cluttered house and wears Crocs year-round.\n        \n- **Inciting Incident**: Glowling crash-lands in Mr. Gribble‚Äôs backyard during a mysterious meteor shower.\n    \n\n---\n\n### **II. ODD COMPANIONSHIP**\n\n- Mr. Gribble tries to chase Glowling off but accidentally activates a dormant toy prototype the creature bonds with.\n    \n- Glowling communicates through gestures and light pulses; Mr. Gribble reluctantly agrees to help ‚Äúthe squishy light blob‚Äù find its way home.\n    \n- Hints drop that Glowling is being hunted by energy-harvesting drones that detect life signatures.\n    \n\n---\n\n### **III. ON THE RUN**\n\n- The unlikely pair travels across quirky towns and mechanical ruins using Gribble‚Äôs old inventions and Glowling‚Äôs radiant powers.\n    \n- They form a reluctant bond: Glowling‚Äôs innocence reawakens Mr. Gribble‚Äôs long-lost joy for inventing and storytelling.\n    \n- Mr. Gribble starts to open up about his past: the loss of his family, the failure of his toy business, and why he lives in isolation.\n    \n\n---\n\n### **IV. THE STANDOFF**\n\n- They‚Äôre cornered by the interstellar drones in the abandoned amusement park Gribble helped design in his prime.\n    \n- Mr. Gribble reactivates old animatronics and toys as a final defense.\n    \n- Glowling sacrifices its remaining energy to save Mr. Gribble, seemingly fading away in a brilliant flash.\n    \n\n---\n\n### **V. EPILOGUE: A NEW LIGHT**\n\n- Months later, Mr. Gribble has reopened his workshop ‚Äî this time designing new toys inspired by Glowling.\n    \n- A mysterious glowing seed is seen pulsing in a small terrarium on his workbench.\n    \n- The story ends with a familiar _puff_ sound and a soft glow filling the room...\n    \n\n---\n\nWould you like this developed into a full script, storyboard, or chapter draft next?","x":-1578,"y":-1680,"width":250,"height":240},
