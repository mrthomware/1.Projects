Here is the **Risk Management Plan** for the project **"Animatronic Control System Design & Simulation"**, designed to address both internal and external challenges that could affect timeline, quality, or completion:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### üö® Potential Risks

#### **Risk 1: Servo Hardware Failure or Limited Motion Precision**

* **Description**: Low-cost servo motors (e.g., SG90, MG996R) may wear out quickly or lack the precision needed for lifelike puppet movement.
* **Impact**: Could delay testing phases, result in jittery movement, or cause desynchronization with audio.

#### **Risk 2: Audio-Motion Synchronization Delays**

* **Description**: The control logic may fail to consistently maintain <50ms delay between audio and motion triggers.
* **Impact**: Decreases believability of performance; may require full refactoring of the control approach.

#### **Risk 3: Project Scope Overload**

* **Description**: Adding too many features (multi-puppet support, Obsidian plugins, advanced UI) could extend beyond available time or resources.
* **Impact**: Incomplete deliverables or missed deadlines, potential burnout.

#### **Risk 4: Toolchain Compatibility Issues**

* **Description**: Integration between Obsidian markdown notes, Python control scripts, and hardware might encounter compatibility or versioning problems.
* **Impact**: Could stall automation features and require additional development time.

#### **Risk 5: Lack of Collaborative Feedback**

* **Description**: Solo development may limit real-time feedback, leading to blind spots in usability, performance, or creative direction.
* **Impact**: Missed improvement opportunities or misalignment with viewer/audience expectations.

### üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

#### ‚úÖ **Mitigation for Risk 1: Hardware Failure**

* **Strategy**: Use well-reviewed servo models, purchase backups, and stress-test components in early prototyping.
* **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
* **Implementation Timeline**: During prototyping (June 15 ‚Äì July 15, 2025)

---

#### ‚úÖ **Mitigation for Risk 2: Sync Inaccuracy**

* **Strategy**: Implement a debug logging system to record timing gaps; apply PID tuning or frame-offset buffering as needed.
* **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
* **Implementation Timeline**: Simulation and sync testing (July 15 ‚Äì August 1, 2025)

---

#### ‚úÖ **Mitigation for Risk 3: Scope Overload**

* **Strategy**: Lock scope after Milestone 2; backlog additional ideas for Phase 2 of the project post-September.
* **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
* **Implementation Timeline**: Scope review checkpoint on August 1, 2025

---

#### ‚úÖ **Mitigation for Risk 4: Toolchain Incompatibility**

* **Strategy**: Use version-controlled environments (e.g., `requirements.txt`, portable Python runtime), and document tested workflows in vault.
* **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
* **Implementation Timeline**: Setup finalized by July 1, 2025

---

#### ‚úÖ **Mitigation for Risk 5: Collaboration Gaps**

* **Strategy**: Post milestone demos to YouTube/Discord; gather external input from maker communities or LinkedIn for testing and review.
* **Responsible Party**: Thomas Ware
* **Implementation Timeline**: Post-demo reviews on July 20 and August 20, 2025

---

### üìä Risk Monitoring and Review

#### ‚úÖ **Monitoring Process**

* Weekly check-ins via Obsidian Task Log
* Maintain a "Risks & Issues" section in the project markdown note
* Mark completed mitigations using Dataview checkboxes

#### ‚úÖ **Review and Adjustment**

* Formal review after each milestone (July 15, August 1, August 15)
* Adjust strategies based on testing results and feedback
* Archive resolved risks with status tags (`#resolved`, `#revised`, etc.)
