Here is a structured list of **Key Deliverables** for your project **"Animatronic Control System Design & Simulation"**, based on your current project vault content and SMART objectives:

---

## ðŸ“¦ Key Deliverables

---

### âœ… **Deliverable 1: Servo Motor Control System (Prototype)**

* **Description**:
  A functional control system built using Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers that manipulates servo motors to execute expressive puppet movements. It includes code to manage joint angles, timing logic, and movement scripts stored in a modular configuration format (e.g., JSON or classes).

* **Purpose**:
  To automate puppet movements with precision and remove the need for manual hand-control during episodes, increasing repeatability and production efficiency.

* **Completion Criteria**:

  * System executes 5 pre-programmed gestures.
  * Operates in sync with a mock audio file (<50ms delay).
  * Passes internal bench test using breadboard prototype.

* **Responsible Parties**:
  Thomas Ware (Lead Engineer, Prototyping)

* **Due Date**:
  **July 15, 2025**

### âœ… **Deliverable 2: Audio-Motion Synchronization Script**

* **Description**:
  A script (likely in Python or C++) that coordinates the timing of puppet motion sequences with audio tracks, ensuring movement matches vocal cues or music. Includes functions for time-stamping and offset calibration.

* **Purpose**:
  To enable tight lip-sync and gesture alignment during puppet performances, improving realism and viewer engagement.

* **Completion Criteria**:

  * Audio and motion alignment confirmed in simulation.
  * Able to process .wav/.mp3 and motion script input.
  * Successful execution with at least 2 puppet actions.

* **Responsible Parties**:
  Thomas Ware (System Integration)

* **Due Date**:
  **August 1, 2025**

### âœ… **Deliverable 3: Modular Character Control Framework**

* **Description**:
  A reusable software module or class structure that supports interchangeable character profiles. Each profile includes servo mappings, audio files, and timing data.

* **Purpose**:
  To allow new puppets to be added with minimal code duplication, ensuring system scalability and adaptability.

* **Completion Criteria**:

  * 3 puppet profiles implemented and tested.
  * Shared base class supports inheritance or plugin configuration.
  * Profiles load correctly and execute assigned scripts.

* **Responsible Parties**:
  Thomas Ware (Software Architecture)

* **Due Date**:
  **August 15, 2025**

---

### âœ… **Deliverable 4: Obsidian Integration Workflow**

* **Description**:
  Automation or embedded links within the Obsidian vault that allow direct playback/testing of a puppet sequence from the storyboard or scene notes. This includes linking `.canvas` files or markdown episodes to their associated control scripts.

* **Purpose**:
  To streamline the production workflow, allowing creative and technical processes to interact seamlessly within the `Control_Freaks_Vault`.

* **Completion Criteria**:

  * At least 1 storyboard note contains an active test trigger.
  * YAML metadata in vault tracks character profile and scene actions.
  * Documentation exists for setting up and using the workflow.

* **Responsible Parties**:
  Thomas Ware (System Designer / Vault Architect)

* **Due Date**:
  **September 1, 2025**

### âœ… **Deliverable 5: Technical Documentation & System Guide**

* **Description**:
  A full documentation set (markdown format) stored in the vault, including system architecture, setup instructions, character profile templates, calibration methods, and user training notes.

* **Purpose**:
  To provide a permanent, searchable reference for future updates, collaborator onboarding, and self-guided operation.

* **Completion Criteria**:

  * README-style guides for all major system components.
  * Screenshots, diagrams, and code samples included.
  * Tested by user walkthrough on a clean setup.

* **Responsible Parties**:
  Thomas Ware (Author)

* **Due Date**:
  **September 10, 2025**
