### üìå Task Detail Highlights

- **T01** ‚Äì Kickstarts the creative cycle with hand-drawn sketches, proportions, and emotive poses for the animatronic.
- **T06** ‚Äì Core scripting of servo behaviors using Arduino or Raspberry Pi interfaces. This defines character motion.
- **T09** ‚Äì Live-action motion recording using pre-programmed servos in sync with dialogue, ensuring proper storytelling.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- All tasks depend on milestone reviews and may shift slightly during sprint feedback sessions.
- Any delay in **T03‚ÄìT06** directly affects build readiness, so buffer days are pre-built into the timeline.
- Assignments reflect both internal team members and freelance collaborators under NDA.
