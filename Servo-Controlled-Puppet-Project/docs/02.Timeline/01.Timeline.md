# Project Timeline for Control Freaks Vault

## Project Overview

The *Control Freaks Vault* is an umbrella project comprising two integrated yet distinct tracks:

1. **Servo-Controlled Puppet Project** (`CT##` Tasks): Focused on the technical and mechanical development of animatronic puppets.
2. **YouTube Production Project** (`T##` Tasks): Focused on storytelling, video production, and content creation using the puppets.

* **Project Start Date**: 2025-06-08
* **Projected End Date**: 2025-07-15

Both projects progress in parallel and share resources, dependencies, and coordination milestones.
