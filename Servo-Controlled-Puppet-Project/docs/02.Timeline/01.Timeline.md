Here is your **Project Timeline Template** contextualized for the **Control Freaks Vault** project â€” a studio-driven animatronic puppet design and development workflow. The timeline structure has been adapted to suit creative prototyping, animatronics development, and content production cycles typical of *Control Freaks*.

## Dependencies

- T03 depends on the completion of T02 (Modeling)
- T04 cannot start before T03 (Parts are required)
- T05 requires T04 for live testing
- T06 and T07 must be complete before T08 (Final Edit)

## Buffer Time

- +2 Days buffer after T03 for 3D Printer failures
- +3 Days after T05 for code debugging and retesting
- Overall project buffer: 7 days

---

## Critical Path

- T02 â†’ T03 â†’ T04 â†’ T05 â†’ T06 â†’ T08

These tasks form the **core production sequence** for puppet building and integration with content creation. Any delay directly impacts the project release.

## Flexibility and Adjustments

The timeline incorporates buffers and iterative review points. We remain flexible on content iterations depending on test footage quality, servo reliability, or voiceover sessions. Adjustments to deadlines will be communicated during sprint reviews.

---

## Integration with Overall Project Plan

* **Budget**: Matches estimates for equipment and freelance contractors.
* **Resource Plan**: Aligned with available studio assets and schedule.
* **Risk Management**: Includes backup hardware, spare parts, and alternate storytelling formats.

---

**Note**: This timeline will be reviewed weekly and updated in the *Control Freaks Vault > Project\_Management > Timeline.md* file.
