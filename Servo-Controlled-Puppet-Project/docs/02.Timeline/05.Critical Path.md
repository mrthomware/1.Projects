## 🚨 Critical Path – Control Freaks Vault

### 🧭 Identification of the Critical Path

The **critical path** is the sequence of dependent tasks that determines the shortest time to complete the Control Freaks puppet production and launch. Delay in any of these tasks results in a delay to the entire project.

### 📋 Details of Critical Path Tasks

#### **T01 – Sketch Designs**
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Dependency**: None (project start)
- **Notes**: Establishes visual identity and initial concept for puppet motion and look.

#### **T02 – 3D CAD Modeling**
- **Duration**: 5 days
- **Depends on**: Completion of T01
- **Notes**: Generates .STL files for 3D printing; defines servo joint placements and clearances.

#### **T03 – 3D Printing**
- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Depends on**: Completion of T02
- **Notes**: Includes print, cleanup, and QA for mechanical parts.

#### **T04 – Puppet Assembly**
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Depends on**: T03
- **Notes**: Assembles skeleton, mounts servo brackets, and aligns mechanical motion.

#### **T05 – Wiring Electronics**
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Depends on**: Completion of physical assembly (T04)
- **Notes**: Involves Arduino/RPi setup, power distribution, and servo test scripts.

#### **T06 – Programming Servo Motions**
- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Depends on**: T05
- **Notes**: Core software that drives movement sequences and is reused in animation.

#### **T07 – Animation Sync Testing**
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Depends on**: T06
- **Notes**: Validates that servos move in sync with intended scene timing.

#### **T09 – Scene Recording**
- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Depends on**: T07
- **Notes**: Final puppet performance is filmed; movement must be finalized.

#### **T11 – Video Editing**
- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Depends on**: T09 and T10 (Audio Design)
- **Notes**: Final storytelling polish, effects, transitions, and export to final video.

#### **T12 – Upload and Launch**
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Depends on**: T11
- **Notes**: Prepares SEO, metadata, and schedules YouTube publishing.

### 📌 Managing the Critical Path

- **Monitoring**: Daily check-ins on T02 through T07 during build weeks; mid-sprint video reviews during T09–T11.
- **Resource Prioritization**: Fabrication resources and coding support allocated to T03–T06; studio crew focused on T09–T12.
- **Risk Mitigation**:
  - Backup microcontrollers and servo hardware in stock.
  - Contingency plan for extended rendering time during T11 (extra GPU allocation).

---

### 🔁 Flexibility and Re-Evaluation

- Tasks such as **T08 (Storyboarding)** and **T10 (Audio Design)**, while important, are *not* on the critical path and can be scheduled in parallel.
- Weekly reviews will reassess task durations and modify the critical path if needed (e.g., if delays shift sequencing logic).
