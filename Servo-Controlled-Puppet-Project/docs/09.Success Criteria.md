Here is the **Success Criteria** section for your project **"Animatronic Control System Design & Simulation"**, structured to ensure measurable outcomes that align with your SMART objectives and project deliverables.

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

---

### üìè **Criteria 1: Audio-Motion Synchronization Accuracy**

* **Description**: Successful real-time synchronization between puppet servo movements and associated audio playback, ensuring lifelike performance and audience immersion.

* **Measurement Method**:
  Time logs from control system scripts will be reviewed to ensure servo signals align within 50ms of pre-defined audio cue timestamps. Visual confirmation via simulation playback or camera recording will be conducted for validation.

* **Target**:
  **‚â§ 50 milliseconds average delay** between audio cue and movement execution in at least 3 test scenarios.

---

### üß† **Criteria 2: Modular Character Control Framework Implementation**

* **Description**: A reusable and extensible control framework that supports motion/audio scripts for three different puppet characters using configuration files or modules.

* **Measurement Method**:
  Functionality will be verified through unit testing and scenario-based trials, ensuring each character profile runs independently without modification to core system logic.

* **Target**:
  **3 working character profiles** loaded from modular configuration files or classes without manual code changes to the control logic.

---

### üìÇ **Criteria 3: Obsidian Vault Workflow Integration**

* **Description**: Automation of puppet scenes from within Obsidian using embedded links or task triggers, connecting creative and technical workflows.

* **Measurement Method**:
  Vault review will confirm at least one `Episode_Storyboard.canvas` file includes script-linked triggers. Usability will be tested by generating motion sequences directly from a vault note.

* **Target**:
  **1 fully working Obsidian storyboard note** with embedded control script or simulation trigger.

---

### üìù **Criteria 4: Completion of All Key Deliverables**

* **Description**: Full delivery of each promised output as outlined in the Deliverables section, on time and to specification.

* **Measurement Method**:
  Checkoff validation of each deliverable against specs (servo system, sync script, control framework, integration, documentation) via Git/Obsidian and project logs.

* **Target**:
  **100% of deliverables completed** by **September 10, 2025**, with documentation for each.

---

### üé• **Criteria 5: Demo Video with Audience Feedback**

* **Description**: Creation of a short performance video featuring the animatronic control system in action and gathering real feedback from viewers.

* **Measurement Method**:
  Upload video to YouTube; assess viewer engagement and commentary.

* **Target**:
  **1 published demo video** + **minimum of 5 constructive audience comments** related to realism or storytelling improvement.

---

## üìä Continuous Evaluation

* **Review Points**:

  * Midpoint success check: **August 1, 2025**
  * Final evaluation: **September 10, 2025**

* **Adjustment Plans**:

  * Weekly review of project progress in Obsidian.
  * Scope, timeline, or deliverable revisions to be made based on milestone feedback and resource constraints.
  * Issues logged in vault for future reference and iterative improvements.
