Here's an example of a Mermaid flowchart that visualizes a typical project management process:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Project] --> B[Define Project Scope]
    B --> C[Develop Project Plan]
    C --> D[Allocate Resources]
    D --> E[Execution Phase]
    E --> F[Monitor and Control]
    F --> G{Check Milestones}
    G -->|On Track| H[Continue Execution]
    G -->|Off Track| I[Adjust Plan & Resources]
    H --> J[Completion Phase]
    I --> E
    J --> K[Deliver Project]
    K --> L[Project Closure]
    L --> M[Post-Project Review]
    M --> N[End Project]
```

In this flowchart:
- The project starts and then moves into defining the project scope.
- After the scope is defined, a detailed project plan is developed.
- Resources are then allocated based on the project plan.
- The project enters the execution phase, during which project activities are carried out.
- During execution, ongoing monitoring and control processes are in place.
- Regularly, the project's progress is checked against milestones.
- If the project is on track, execution continues; if off track, the plan and resources are adjusted.
- Eventually, the project moves into the completion phase.
- The project is then delivered, followed by project closure activities.
- A post-project review is conducted to gather learnings and best practices.
- Finally, the project is officially ended.
