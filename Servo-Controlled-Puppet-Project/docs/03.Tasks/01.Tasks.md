# Task: Servo Bracket Design

## Task Description
Design and prototype the servo mounting brackets for facial motion. Ensure compatibility with chosen micro-servo model and puppet head structure.

## Task Owner
Thomas Ware

## Dependencies
- Final servo model selection
- Head shell dimensions finalized

## Duration
3 days (design + print + fit test)

## Start and End Dates
2025-06-10 â€“ 2025-06-12

## Resources Required
- CAD software (Fusion 360)
- 3D printer and filament
- Digital caliper for fit verification

## Priority Level
High

## Progress Indicators
- CAD model completed
- 3D print successfully fits
- Screws and alignment tested

## Risk Factors
- Servo heat affecting fit
- Design iteration required for final motion range

## Integration with Project Goals
Critical component for animatronic expression; enables eye/mouth movement control.

## Flexibility for Adjustments
Design must allow for versioning based on puppet model changes.

## Documentation and Tracking
All design files saved in `/Designs/ServoMounts`. Version history in GitHub. Physical test notes in build log.

## Notes/Comments
Consider modular mounting clips to simplify assembly.
