# Task: Facial Motion Mechanism (Servo Design)

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T003
- **Description**: Design the mechanical actuation system for the puppet’s facial expressions including eyebrows, eyes, eyelids, and jaw. This involves selecting appropriate micro servos, creating bracket designs, defining the actuation angles and linkages, and ensuring compatibility with internal space and skin tolerance. The system must allow for expressive movement while fitting within a constrained enclosure.
- **Assigned To**: Mechanical Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-13
- **End Date**: 2025-06-17
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Awaiting head shell dimensions from CAD Team
  - Planning kickoff meeting with FX and Electronics leads on June 13
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Fusion 360 or equivalent CAD software
  - Test servos (MG90S, SG90)
  - 3D printer and PLA for bracket prototyping
  - Puppet head physical prototype (if available)
- **Dependencies**:
  - 3D shell design (CF-T004)
  - Confirmed servo models from Electrical Team
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Balancing torque vs. speed in servo selection
  - Ensuring servo positions don’t conflict with wiring harness
  - Maintaining repeatable motion without backlash
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Primary mechanism for puppet expressiveness
  - Directly influences visual realism and audience engagement
  - Critical for syncing facial actions with audio and programmed behaviors

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Suggest designing servo mounts to be modular/removable for repair
  - FX Team recommends allocating room for a silicone skin anchor point near jawline
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May switch to metal gear servos if strain testing on plastic brackets shows deformation
