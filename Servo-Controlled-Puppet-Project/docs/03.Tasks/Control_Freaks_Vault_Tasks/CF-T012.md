# Task: Final System Integration

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T012
- **Description**: Combine all mechanical, electrical, and software systems into the complete puppet assembly. This task includes final placement of modules, routing of internal harnesses, mounting of the puppet skin, calibration of motion ranges, and system validation. Deliverables include the fully assembled puppet, final photos/videos for documentation, and a sign-off checklist verifying all subsystems.
- **Assigned To**: Thomas Ware
- **Start Date**: 2025-07-01
- **End Date**: 2025-07-03
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Integration plan outlined in project vault
  - All subsystem leads notified of integration timeline
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Workbench and full toolkit
  - Final 3D-printed shell and brackets
  - Wiring harness, servos, skin, control board
  - Access to control scripts and calibration logs
- **Dependencies**:
  - All prior tasks (CF-T002 through CF-T011) must be completed and tested
  - Software calibration scripts from CF-T010
  - Fully fabricated puppet skin from CF-T007
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Tight fit may require re-routing or connector trimming
  - Final tests must avoid overheating, binding, or desync
  - Time buffer needed for unexpected integration conflicts
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Marks transition from development to production-ready prototype
  - Required for demo recording, QA inspection, and team review
  - Success determines puppet's readiness for deployment and content creation

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Suggest scheduling QA sign-off checklist with subsystem leads after each integration milestone
  - Allow overnight system rest before final test to check for thermal drift
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Add breakaway power connector to simplify teardown and transport
  - Planned integration location moved to MakerBench A to allow tool access
