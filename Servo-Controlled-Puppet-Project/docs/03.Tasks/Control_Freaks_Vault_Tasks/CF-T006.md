# Task: Cable Routing and Mounting Architecture

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T006
- **Description**: Plan and implement the cable management system inside the puppet structure. This includes routing paths for servo wires, power lines, audio cables, and control signals while ensuring minimal strain, heat dissipation, accessibility for repairs, and EMI reduction. The routing plan must allow for maintenance access and future upgrades. Deliverables include internal routing diagram, mounting clip models, and documentation on connector types and labeling scheme.
- **Assigned To**: Mechatronics Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-21
- **End Date**: 2025-06-23
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Awaiting completed shell model from CAD Team (CF-T004)
  - Placeholder wire harness mockup ready for integration
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Velcro straps, heat shrink tubing, and zip ties
  - JST connectors, cable sleeves
  - 3D printer for mounting clip designs
  - Electrical routing diagrams and pinout schematics
- **Dependencies**:
  - Servo and module layout finalized (CF-T002, CF-T003, CF-T005)
  - Space availability in internal puppet skeleton (CF-T004)
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Avoiding wire interference with moving parts (e.g., jaw, eyes)
  - Managing thermal loads from bundled power lines
  - Designing secure yet serviceable routing clips
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Ensures clean, organized, and serviceable internal layout
  - Reduces risk of electrical shorts, signal crosstalk, or wear-related failures
  - Contributes to long-term reliability and safe demo operation

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Engineering team recommends modular harness sections with quick-disconnects
  - Suggestion to add LED indicators for power zones
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Shift to ribbon cable in tight areas may be required if round bundles interfere with shell form
  - Labeling standard updated to use colored heat shrink for signal ID
