# Task: Jaw Actuation Mechanism

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T009
- **Description**: Design, assemble, and install the jaw actuation mechanism responsible for opening and closing the puppet’s mouth in sync with audio playback. The system must be lightweight, responsive, and capable of repeatable motion under variable timing. Includes linkage design, servo torque validation, damping consideration, and compatibility with the sound module and skin flex.
- **Assigned To**: Robotics Lead
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-22
- **End Date**: 2025-06-25
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Linkage concepts under review from earlier puppet builds
  - Awaiting CAD jaw mount specs from CF-T004
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - High-torque micro servo (metal gear preferred)
  - Spring-loaded return system (for passive close assist)
  - Jaw hinge model from 3D shell
  - Oscilloscope and servo tester for timing alignment
- **Dependencies**:
  - Finalized puppet head geometry (CF-T004)
  - Audio sync logic from CF-T005
  - Servo control system architecture from CF-T002
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Minimizing noise and vibration during jaw motion
  - Matching movement profile to audio without lag
  - Ensuring hinge pivot is durable over time and under load
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Central to the puppet’s expressiveness and believability
  - Required for sound synchronization and demo performance accuracy
  - Impacts user experience and perceived production quality

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Creative team requested soft stop or bounce damping at jaw close
  - Engineering team exploring alternate pivot placement for tighter mouth seal
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - Potential transition to dual-servo jaw control if torque limits are reached
  - Delay in skin fitting test may shift servo installation window by 1 day
