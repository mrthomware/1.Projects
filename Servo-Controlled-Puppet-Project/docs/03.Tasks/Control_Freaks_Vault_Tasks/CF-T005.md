# Task: Integrate Sound Module & Sync Logic

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T005
- **Description**: Integrate an onboard sound module (such as DFPlayer Mini or Adafruit Sound FX Board) into the puppet system, ensuring that audio playback is synchronized with jaw and facial motions. This includes signal routing, voltage compatibility, volume tuning, and script logic for lip-sync behavior. Deliverables include wiring schematics, Arduino (or equivalent) control script, and test results for timing alignment.
- **Assigned To**: Electronics Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-18
- **End Date**: 2025-06-20
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - Awaiting final motion bracket installation (CF-T003)
  - Initial prototyping scheduled for June 18
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - DFPlayer Mini + Micro SD card + Audio files
  - Arduino Nano or ESP32
  - Breadboard, logic analyzer, oscilloscope
  - Access to 3D-printed puppet shell (for fit testing)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Jaw motion design finalized (CF-T009)
  - Control system logic block approval (CF-T002)
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Synchronization of motion-to-audio with minimal latency
  - Isolation of power lines to avoid noise interference
  - Safe shutdown behavior in case of audio failure
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Brings the puppet to life with real-time audio-visual synchronization
  - Essential for storytelling, demo presentations, and production performance
  - Affects user perception of realism and professional build quality

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - FX team requested ability to trigger custom sounds based on user input
  - Robotics team advised pre-mapping audio file lengths to motion triggers
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May shift from Arduino to ESP32 if multi-channel expansion is required
  - Consider adding Bluetooth support for remote triggering during rehearsals
