# Task: Internal Wiring Harness Build

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T011
- **Description**: Fabricate and install the internal wiring harness that connects all servos, sensors, audio modules, and power components. The harness must be modular, labeled, and built to fit the defined routing channels within the puppet shell. It should support easy disconnects for maintenance and include strain relief where needed. Deliverables include wiring diagrams, harness layout map, and a tested build ready for final integration.
- **Assigned To**: Assembly Team
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-26
- **End Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - BOM reviewed with Electronics Team
  - JST and Dupont connectors ordered
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Wire spools (22–26 AWG), crimping tools, heat shrink
  - JST-SM connectors, Dupont headers, terminal blocks
  - Label printer, color-coded sleeves, continuity tester
- **Dependencies**:
  - Finalized layout from CF-T006 (Cable Routing Architecture)
  - Power distribution schema and servo assignments from CF-T002, CF-T003
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Managing wire tension across moving parts
  - Avoiding cross-talk between signal and power lines
  - Routing within narrow shell corridors without abrasion
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Forms the backbone of the puppet’s electronic infrastructure
  - Ensures safe and organized connections for all modules
  - Required before final integration and motion tests can occur

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Software Lead requested consistent color-coding across all signal lines
  - Recommendation to leave slack loops at servo endpoints for movement tolerance
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - May shift to ribbon bundles for eye mechanisms if tight routing issues persist
  - Labeling format updated to include zone ID and destination component
