# Task: Final QA Review and Documentation

## Task Overview

- **Task ID**: CF-T015
- **Description**: Conduct a comprehensive quality assurance (QA) review of the fully assembled puppet, ensuring all subsystems (mechanical, electrical, software, and cosmetic) meet project specifications. Validate functional consistency, safety standards, and system durability under simulated use. Document all findings, including part serials, calibration settings, maintenance tips, and issue logs. Deliverables include a QA sign-off sheet, final system schematic, and archival summary in the vault.
- **Assigned To**: All Leads
- **Start Date**: 2025-07-14
- **End Date**: 2025-07-15
- **Status**: not started
- **Progress Details**:
  - QA checklist drafted
  - Documentation templates uploaded to `/Standards/QA_Docs.md`
- **Resources Allocated**:
  - Full puppet assembly and motion controller
  - QA checklist, issue tracker
  - Digital calipers, multimeter, and oscilloscope
  - Access to Obsidian Vault for notes and final logs
- **Dependencies**:
  - All build and programming tasks completed (CF-T001 to CF-T014)
  - Functional testing from CF-T013 verified
- **Challenges or Issues**:
  - Time constraints for thorough inspection of all components
  - Ensuring all logs and changes are up-to-date across teams
  - Final storage and packaging must align with teardown checklist
- **Impact on Project**:
  - Confirms project is ready for demo, presentation, or shipment
  - Archives all technical data for future maintenance or reproduction
  - Provides a closure checkpoint that validates design quality and documentation rigor

## Additional Notes

- **Feedback or Concerns**:
  - Request to include failure simulation for servo disconnect and power loss
  - Suggest adding a “lessons learned” section to the final log for future project cycles
- **Adjustments or Changes**:
  - QA pass criteria adjusted to include noise threshold from servo arrays
  - Documentation layout revised to group content by subsystem for readability
