## üìå Notes

- Each task will be broken out into its own `.md` file with full YAML metadata and status tracking.
- All files will be stored in: `Control_Freaks_Vault/Tasks/`
- Tasks with dependencies will include them in the YAML and progress tracking sections.

üìÅ **Next Step**: Would you like me to auto-generate Markdown files for each task in this list (with full structure and YAML)?
