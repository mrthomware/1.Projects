## 📝 Stakeholder Management Plan

### 📣 Communication Plan

| Stakeholder Group         | Frequency         | Medium                       | Shared Information                          |
|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Thomas Ware (self)        | Daily              | Obsidian, Git, Notes         | Technical notes, project logs, Gantt status |
| YouTube Viewers           | Bi-weekly          | YouTube, Shorts, LinkedIn    | Updates, progress videos, release promos    |
| Potential Contributors    | As-needed          | Email, Discord, GitHub       | Demo pitches, task-specific documentation   |
| Potential Sponsors        | Milestone-based    | PDF Reports, Email Briefings | Progress updates, tool request summaries    |

### 🔗 Engagement Strategy

- **Solo Developer Practices**:
  - Weekly Obsidian reviews aligned to the timeline.
  - Logging challenges and blockers in YAML-based logs.
  - Scheduling light production sprints (2–4 days per phase).

- **Audience Activation**:
  - Include polls, shoutouts, and behind-the-scenes reels.
  - Promote transparency in what’s solo-built versus scripted/edited.

- **Community Outreach**:
  - Share codebase and documentation to maker forums after Phase 2 (Puppet complete).
  - Submit documentation for feedback or open-source consideration.
