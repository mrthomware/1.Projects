# ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives and Goals â€“ Control Freaks Vault

This project is organized around **three integrated development areas**, each with SMART goals to guide scope and outcomes:

---

## ðŸ§  1. Controller Development

### âœ… Objective: Design and Simulate a Custom Puppet Control System

- **Specific**: Build a controller that synchronizes servo-driven puppet actions with audio cues and can interface with various puppet modules via a unified communication protocol (e.g. I2C/SPI).
- **Measurable**: Achieve sub-50ms latency between audio and mechanical output in simulation.
- **Achievable**: Use ESP32 or Arduino microcontrollers and test within a real-time simulator like Tinkercad Circuits or Proteus.
- **Relevant**: Provides the technical backbone for animatronic fidelity and timing.
- **Time-bound**: Complete controller and test firmware by **July 2, 2025**.

## ðŸ§± 2. Puppet Development

### âœ… Objective: Build a Fully Functional Animatronic Puppet System

- **Specific**: Fabricate a servo-driven puppet shell with a modular jaw, eye, and facial animation system, tested through a full range of mechanical motions.
- **Measurable**: The puppet must complete a scripted motion sequence (10 actions) synced to sound with <5% error across repeated cycles.
- **Achievable**: Leverage CAD modeling, 3D printing, and FX fabrication tools already in place.
- **Relevant**: Ensures the physical expressiveness needed for storytelling and YouTube content.
- **Time-bound**: Complete by **July 24, 2025**, with motion-tested integration.

## ðŸŽ¬ 3. YouTube Channel Development

### âœ… Objective: Produce a Complete Episode Demonstrating the Puppet

- **Specific**: Script, shoot, and edit a 3â€“5 minute puppet scene with integrated audio, motion, and narration.
- **Measurable**: Completion of all production tasks and successful upload to YouTube.
- **Achievable**: Use existing recording and editing equipment and templates from past projects.
- **Relevant**: Showcases project outcomes, builds audience engagement, and promotes Control Freaks as a brand.
- **Time-bound**: Publish by **August 2, 2025**.

---

## Integration Objective

### âœ… Objective: Seamlessly Connect Project Workflows within Obsidian

- **Specific**: Embed motion/audio cue logs and task documentation directly into Obsidianâ€™s vault structure for each phase of the project.
- **Measurable**: Each task should include a YAML header, real-time status, and Gantt-linked dates.
- **Achievable**: Maintain within the existing PARA-aligned vault and Dataview/Canvas tools.
- **Relevant**: Centralizes technical, creative, and production efforts into a manageable personal system.
- **Time-bound**: Integration complete by **August 15, 2025**.
