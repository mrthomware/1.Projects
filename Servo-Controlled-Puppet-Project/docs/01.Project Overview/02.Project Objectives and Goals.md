## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives and Goals

### âœ… **Objective 1: Develop and Simulate a Synchronized Control System for an Animatronic Puppet**

* **Specific**: Design a fully functional control system capable of synchronizing puppet movements (via servo motors) with pre-recorded audio (dialogue/music) for at least one character used in *BlackBook Tales*.

* **Measurable**: Success is measured by the system achieving <50ms delay between audio and corresponding motion, as validated through simulation logs and playback accuracy tests.

* **Achievable**: The project will leverage existing tools like Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers, Python or C++ for control logic, and Obsidian for workflow tracking. A simulated environment will reduce prototyping time before physical implementation.

* **Relevant**: This objective directly supports your core need to eliminate desynchronization issues and increase production quality in puppet episodes, aligning with the broader strategic goal of delivering professional-level content on a small team/budget.

* **Time-bound**: Completion by **August 1, 2025**, with simulation demonstration completed by **July 15, 2025**.

### âœ… **Objective 2: Build a Modular Control Architecture for Reuse Across Multiple Puppet Characters**

* **Specific**: Design a modular software framework (with configuration profiles) to support control of at least three different puppet characters with varying joint and audio needs.

* **Measurable**: The goal is to create one base control class/module and three derived character configurations that can be independently triggered and tested with their own motion/audio profiles.

* **Achievable**: The team has access to prior character blueprints and motion planning tools, with enough technical knowledge in servo programming and modular software design to execute this.

* **Relevant**: The modular approach ensures scalability and future-proofing of the puppet control system, lowering onboarding time for new characters and episodes.

* **Time-bound**: Framework completion by **August 15, 2025**, with 3 character configs finalized and demoed by **August 25, 2025**.

### âœ… **Objective 3: Integrate the Control System into the Obsidian-Based Episode Production Workflow**

* **Specific**: Link movement/audio trigger scripts to specific *Episode Storyboard* or *Episode Scene* notes within Obsidian, enabling creators to preview or generate performance segments directly from the creative pipeline.

* **Measurable**: The integration will be considered complete when an episode note contains clickable or auto-run embedded links that trigger corresponding servo/audio simulations.

* **Achievable**: This builds on your existing knowledge and Obsidian vault structure, particularly the episode pipeline already defined in the `BlackBook Tales Story Board.canvas` and `Episodes_Index.md`.

* **Relevant**: This increases creative velocity and reduces friction between storyboarding and technical execution â€” a direct benefit to your production process.

* **Time-bound**: Obsidian integration should be tested and functional by **September 1, 2025**.
