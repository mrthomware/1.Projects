# 📜 Scope of Work – Control Freaks Vault

The *Control Freaks Vault* is a one-person, multi-domain initiative. This Scope of Work outlines the boundaries, deliverables, and responsibilities across **three distinct but interconnected development tracks**:

1. 🎛 **Controller Development** – Electronics, firmware, and simulation.
2. 🤖 **Puppet Development** – Physical fabrication and actuator integration.
3. 🎬 **YouTube Channel Development** – Scriptwriting, motion-sync filming, and content publishing.

## ✅ Inclusions

### 🔧 Project Deliverables (Per Track)

#### 🎛 Controller Development

- ✅ **Servo Motor Control System**: Custom-built system using Arduino/ESP32 for synchronized movement/audio.
- ✅ **Digital Simulation**: Bench-tested environment using Proteus, Tinkercad, or Python for verifying timing behavior.
- ✅ **Firmware Library**: Modular C++/Arduino scripts supporting motion triggers, audio cues, and cross-character compatibility.
- ✅ **Control Interface Notes**: Markdown documentation for control theory, servo mapping, and latency results.

#### 🤖 Puppet Development

- ✅ **CAD Models**: 3D design files for puppet frame, servo mounts, and actuation systems.
- ✅ **Prototype Puppet**: Printed using PLA/TPU with jaw and eye actuation mechanisms.
- ✅ **Material Testing Log**: Notes and evaluations on skin materials (foam, silicone, latex).
- ✅ **Motion Trials**: Logs of repeatability, jitter, and reliability tests across scripted sequences.

#### 🎬 YouTube Channel Development

- ✅ **Pilot Episode**: 3–5 minute puppet performance uploaded to the Control Freaks YouTube channel.
- ✅ **Production Assets**: Storyboard, script, and voiceover track aligned with motion cues.
- ✅ **Editing Pipeline**: Footage cut, audio synchronized, and overlays added in local video suite.
- ✅ **Metadata and Upload Notes**: Obsidian-linked checklist for publishing and SEO tags.
