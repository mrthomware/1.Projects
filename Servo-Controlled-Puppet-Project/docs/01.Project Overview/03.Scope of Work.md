# 📜 Scope of Work – Control Freaks Vault

The *Control Freaks Vault* is a one-person, multi-domain initiative. This Scope of Work outlines the boundaries, deliverables, and responsibilities across **three distinct but interconnected development tracks**:

1. 🎛 **Controller Development** – Electronics, firmware, and simulation.
2. 🤖 **Puppet Development** – Physical fabrication and actuator integration.
3. 🎬 **YouTube Channel Development** – Scriptwriting, motion-sync filming, and content publishing.

## ✅ Inclusions

### 🔧 Project Deliverables (Per Track)

#### 🎛 Controller Development

* ✅ **Servo Motor Control System**: Custom-built system using Arduino/ESP32 for synchronized movement/audio.
* ✅ **Digital Simulation**: Bench-tested environment using Proteus, Tinkercad, or Python script for verifying timing behavior.
* ✅ **Firmware Library**: Modular C++/Arduino scripts supporting motion triggers, audio cues, and cross-character compatibility.
* ✅ **Control Interface Notes**: Markdown documentation for control theory, servo mapping, latency data.

#### 🤖 Puppet Development

* ✅ **CAD Files**: 3D models for the puppet's skeletal structure, jaw, eye mounts, and shell.
* ✅ **Fabricated Puppet**: PLA/TPU printed prototype with integrated servo mounts.
* ✅ **Skin Testing Notes**: Test results for foam, silicone, or other flexible materials.
* ✅ **Motion Performance Log**: Record of scripted movements and repeatability test results.

#### 🎬 YouTube Channel Development

* ✅ **Pilot Episode**: 3–5 minute animatronic scene uploaded to the Control Freaks YouTube channel.
* ✅ **Script & Voice Track**: Finalized Obsidian-based script + recorded audio synced to puppet actions.
* ✅ **Storyboard/Shot List**: Planning documents tied to timeline and motion triggers.
* ✅ **Episode Timeline Gantt**: Integrated with Obsidian vault and controller schedule.
