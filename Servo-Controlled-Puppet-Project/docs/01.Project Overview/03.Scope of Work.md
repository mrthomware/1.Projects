## 📜 Scope of Work

### ✅ Inclusions

#### 🔧 **Project Deliverables**

* ✅ **Servo Motor Control System**: Hardware and software configuration files for at least 1 animatronic puppet (e.g., servo motor wiring diagrams, control script files).
* ✅ **Simulation Model**: A digital simulation environment for testing timing between movement and audio using platforms such as Python, Arduino IDE, or simulation tools.
* ✅ **Control Framework**: Modular codebase capable of supporting 3 puppet characters with pluggable movement/audio profiles.
* ✅ **Obsidian Integration Layer**: Embedded link or automation workflow inside episode storyboards to trigger simulations or audio-motion sequences.
* ✅ **Technical Documentation**: Markdown files stored in Obsidian detailing system architecture, configuration instructions, and usage guidelines.

#### 🛠️ **Services Provided**

* 🎯 Control logic design (PID/digital logic)
* 🔁 Audio-motion sync calibration
* ⚙️ Microcontroller programming (Arduino/C++)
* 🧠 Storyboard-to-automation scripting
* 🧑‍🏫 Training notes for future collaborators

#### 🧩 **Project Activities**

* System architecture design
* Actuator (servo) configuration and testing
* Software prototyping and modular scripting
* Obsidian workflow enhancement and linking
* Internal review and episode demo simulation

#### 🧰 **Resources Involved**

* **Human Resources**: Thomas Ware (lead designer/engineer); optional collaborators (e.g., voice actors, testers)
* **Technology**: Arduino Nano/ESP32, Python, Obsidian, servo motors, audio playback hardware

### ❌ Exclusions

#### 🚫 **Non-Included Deliverables**

* No physical fabrication of full puppet frames beyond test rigs
* No final production-ready puppets (only testing figures or sketches)
* No commercial distribution software (open prototype only)

#### 🚫 **Out-of-Scope Services**

* Full professional animation or rigging in Blender/Cinema4D
* External stakeholder onboarding (e.g., hiring new collaborators)
* Mobile app or cloud-based implementation of control systems

#### 🚫 **Limitations on Activities**

* No integration with external AI motion-capture tools
* No multi-language audio support or speech recognition modules

#### 🚫 **Resource Constraints**

* Limited to low-cost hardware (Arduino-based systems)
* No access to industrial-grade servos or high-torque actuators
* Testing environment restricted to local machines only (no cloud simulation)

#### 🚫 **Stakeholder Limitations**

* Limited feedback loop from YouTube until after pilot episode release
* No budget or time allocated for third-party QA testing

#### 🚫 **Timeframe Boundaries**

* Any work required after September 10, 2025, is considered **out of scope** for this phase of the project
