## 🎛️ Controller Development

### ✅ Deliverable 1: Servo Motor Control Prototype

- **Description**: Build a working controller using Arduino/ESP32 to manage servo sequences with low-latency audio sync.
- **Purpose**: Core logic driver for animatronic gestures.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Controls 3+ servo channels
  - Responds to test audio triggers
  - <50ms sync delay (measured)
- **Due Date**: **June 25, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

---

### ✅ Deliverable 2: Motion-Audio Sync Firmware

- **Description**: Create Arduino-based codebase with time-stamped gesture/audio cues.
- **Purpose**: Ensures repeatable lip-sync and emotional motion.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Syncs .wav or .mp3 audio with servo positions
  - Logs motion timing
  - Tested across 2 puppet motion types
- **Due Date**: **July 2, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

---

### ✅ Deliverable 3: Modular Character Control Framework

- **Description**: Write a scalable firmware architecture supporting character-specific servo maps and profiles.
- **Purpose**: Enables reusability for future puppet characters.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - 3 profile templates
  - Plugin-based motion logic
  - Executable from command set
- **Due Date**: **July 5, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

## 🤖 Puppet Development

### ✅ Deliverable 4: Functional Animatronic Puppet Shell

- **Description**: Fabricate and assemble a head/upper-body puppet with mounted servo mechanisms.
- **Purpose**: Visual and mechanical platform for demo scene.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - 3-axis control (head, jaw, eyes)
  - Fitted skin and structure
  - Safety check and mechanical test
- **Due Date**: **July 18, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware
