# 📦 Key Deliverables – Control Freaks Vault

This project has been divided into **three interlinked domains**, each with defined deliverables supporting the overall objective of launching an animatronic-driven YouTube episode.

---

## 🎛️ Controller Development

### ✅ Deliverable 1: Servo Motor Control System (Prototype)

- **Description**: A functional control system using Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers to manage servo motion. Includes modular scripts and timing logic for puppet actuation.
- **Purpose**: Enables automated and repeatable puppet gestures.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Executes 5 gesture sequences
  - <50ms sync latency with test audio
  - Bench-tested on breadboard
- **Due Date**: **July 15, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

---

### ✅ Deliverable 2: Audio-Motion Synchronization Script

- **Description**: Software that synchronizes servo gestures with vocal/audio tracks using timestamps and offsets.
- **Purpose**: Supports lip-sync and expressive timing.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Supports .wav/.mp3 input
  - Syncs 2+ puppet actions
  - Simulated demo pass
- **Due Date**: **August 1, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

### ✅ Deliverable 3: Modular Character Control Framework

- **Description**: A software framework for defining puppet profiles (servo maps, audio links, timing data).
- **Purpose**: Reusability and profile scalability.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - 3 working puppet profiles
  - Reusable base structure
  - Verified load & execution
- **Due Date**: **August 15, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

## 🧱 Puppet Development

### ✅ Deliverable 4: Animatronic Puppet (Functional Physical Model)

- **Description**: A fully articulated puppet model with servo-actuated head, jaw, and eyes.
- **Purpose**: Physically expressive character for video content.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Eye, jaw, and head mechanisms actuated via controller
  - Skin and shell mounted cleanly
  - Passed range of motion & durability check
- **Due Date**: **July 10, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

---

### ✅ Deliverable 5: Puppet Calibration and Test Suite

- **Description**: A repeatable testing suite to validate physical puppet functions and servo scripts.
- **Purpose**: Ensures puppet performs consistently in production.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Run-through of 10 scripted actions
  - <5% error rate across repetitions
  - Logs for position & timing results
- **Due Date**: **July 15, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

## 📺 YouTube Channel Development

### ✅ Deliverable 6: Pilot Episode (Final Video)

- **Description**: A 3–5 minute edited scene featuring the animatronic puppet performing scripted actions with audio and narration.
- **Purpose**: Showcase technical success and launch the Control Freaks brand channel.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Complete storyline with audio and puppet footage
  - Edited, titled, and branded
  - Uploaded to YouTube
- **Due Date**: **August 1, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

### ✅ Deliverable 7: Behind-the-Scenes and Educational Cut

- **Description**: A supplementary breakdown video explaining the technical and creative process.
- **Purpose**: Adds transparency, builds educational value, and promotes maker culture.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Covers controller logic, mechanical integration, and script editing
  - Includes captions or diagram overlays
  - Separate upload on same YouTube channel
- **Due Date**: **August 8, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

---

### ✅ Deliverable 8: Obsidian Vault Workflow Integration

- **Description**: Automation/workflow system linking control scripts and puppet tasks directly in the Obsidian vault.
- **Purpose**: Centralizes project management and puppet logic.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - At least one episode storyboard links to live servo demo
  - Dataview integration logs script versions
  - Tutorial note on workflow use
- **Due Date**: **September 1, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware

---

### ✅ Deliverable 9: Technical Documentation & System Guide

- **Description**: Full documentation stored in Obsidian for controller firmware, puppet hardware, and media scripting.
- **Purpose**: Knowledge continuity and public sharing.
- **Completion Criteria**:
  - Readme notes, code blocks, and diagrams for all major components
  - Setup checklist and calibration guide
  - PDF export ready for backup
- **Due Date**: **September 10, 2025**
- **Owner**: Thomas Ware
