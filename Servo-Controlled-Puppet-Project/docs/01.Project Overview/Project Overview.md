# ðŸŽ­ Project Overview: Animatronic Control System Design & Simulation

## 1. Background and Purpose

- **Context**:  
  The project is embedded within the independent content creation and robotics field, combining storytelling and automation for YouTubeâ€™s *BlackBook Tales*. It leverages affordable microcontrollers and open-source tools to automate puppet performance.

- **Problem/Opportunity**:  
  Manual puppetry limits realism and scalability. This project addresses the opportunity to introduce a synchronized control system that automates servo movements with audio, reducing human effort and improving output quality.

## 2. Project Objectives and Goals

- **Objective 1**:  
  Design and simulate a servo control system with audio sync accuracy under 50ms â€” *due by August 1, 2025*.
  
- **Objective 2**:  
  Develop a modular motion/audio framework for at least 3 puppet characters â€” *due by August 15, 2025*.
  
- **Objective 3**:  
  Integrate Obsidian with the control system to automate scenes from vault notes â€” *due by September 1, 2025*.
