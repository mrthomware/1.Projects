## üóìÔ∏è Timeline and Milestones

### ‚úÖ **Start Date**

* **Date**: **June 10, 2025**
* **Description**: This is the official kickoff of the project, marking the allocation of resources, the setup of the project workspace in Obsidian, and the initiation of simulation and hardware planning tasks.

---

### üìç **Milestone 1: Servo Control System Prototype**

* **Description**: Complete the initial hardware and software development for servo-based motion control. This includes wiring, codebase setup, and successful test execution of movement sequences.
* **Expected Completion Date**: **July 15, 2025**

---

### üìç **Milestone 2: Audio-Motion Sync Script**

* **Description**: Develop and verify a script that synchronizes motion with pre-recorded audio. The goal is to maintain sub-50ms timing latency between gesture and sound.
* **Expected Completion Date**: **August 1, 2025**

---

### üìç **Milestone 3: Modular Character Framework**

* **Description**: Deliver a reusable software module that supports at least three different character configurations for motion and audio control.
* **Expected Completion Date**: **August 15, 2025**

---

### üìç **Milestone 4: Obsidian Workflow Integration**

* **Description**: Integrate control script triggers or visual timeline previews directly into Obsidian storyboard and scene notes. Demonstrate ability to test puppet scenes from within the vault.
* **Expected Completion Date**: **September 1, 2025**

---

### üìç **Milestone 5: Documentation and Usability Guide**

* **Description**: Finalize technical documentation covering hardware setup, control logic usage, and onboarding instructions for collaborators or future enhancements.
* **Expected Completion Date**: **September 10, 2025**

---

### ‚úÖ **End Date**

* **Projected Completion Date**: **September 10, 2025**
* **Description**: By this date, all core deliverables will be complete, validated through testing or demo episodes, and archived within the `Control_Freaks_Vault`. System is ready for iteration or full-scale content deployment.
