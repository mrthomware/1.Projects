## ðŸŽ¯ **ChatGPT Project: Animatronic Control System Design & Simulation**

### **1. Project Title**

**Design and Simulation of a Control System for an Animatronic Figure with Synchronized Audio-Visual Cues**

---

### **2. Objective**

To design a computer-based control system that manages the real-time operation of an animatronic character, including precise timing and synchronization of movements (motors/actuators) and audio (speech/music), using control systems engineering principles.

---

### **3. Scope**

This project focuses on:

- Modeling the dynamics of servo motors used for facial expressions and gestures.
    
- Designing a control strategy (PID, state-space, or digital logic-based).
    
- Ensuring time synchronization between audio output and motor actuation.
    
- Simulating and testing the system performance using software tools (e.g., MATLAB/Simulink or Python).

### **7. Design Steps**

1. **System Identification**:
    
    - Model actuator dynamics (e.g., transfer function or state-space).
        
2. **Controller Design**:
    
    - Implement a PID or state-space controller for each joint.
        
3. **Synchronization Logic**:
    
    - Time-stamped control scripts to align audio waveform events with motion triggers.
        
4. **Simulation**:
    
    - Use MATLAB/Simulink or Python (with `control`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`) for simulation.
        
5. **Implementation Prototype**:
    
    - Deploy on hardware (e.g., Arduino + servo drivers + SD card audio playback).
        
6. **Testing & Validation**:
    
    - Evaluate synchronization performance, settling time, and tracking error.
