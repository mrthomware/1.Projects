# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview â€“ Note

**Note**: This document provides a structured overview of the project, intended to keep all stakeholders informed and aligned with the project's objectives and progress.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Project Title**: *Animatronic Control System Design & Simulation*

---

## 1. Background and Purpose

- **Context**:  
  As part of the *BlackBook Tales* puppet-driven YouTube channel, this project aims to design and simulate an embedded control system for animatronic puppets that perform scripted movement synchronized with voice and audio playback.

- **Purpose**:  
  To replace manual puppet handling with an automated servo and control logic systemâ€”enhancing storytelling realism, scalability, and production efficiency.

---

## 2. Project Objectives and Goals

- Design a servo motion control system with <50ms audio sync delay  
- Develop a modular framework to support 3 puppet characters  
- Integrate control triggers within the Obsidian production vault  
- Document system workflows and prepare demo for public feedback

---

## 3. Scope of Work

- **Inclusions**:
  - Servo system prototyping
  - Control script design and sync testing
  - Modular character configuration
  - Obsidian note integration
  - Documentation and public demo video

- **Exclusions**:
  - Physical puppet body fabrication
  - AI-generated animation or voice synthesis
  - Post-launch system maintenance

---

## 4. Key Deliverables

- âœ… Working servo control prototype  
- âœ… Audio-motion sync logic (<50ms)  
- âœ… Character-specific control profiles (Ã—3)  
- âœ… Vault-integrated storyboard triggers  
- âœ… Technical guide and documentation  
- âœ… Demo video with user feedback metrics

---

- **Modular Framework**: August 15, 2025  
- **Obsidian Integration**: September 1, 2025  
- **Project Wrap-Up & Video Launch**: September 10, 2025

---

## 6. Budget Overview

- **Total Budget**: $2,000 CAD  
- **Cost Breakdown**:
  - $500 â€“ Materials (servos, boards, connectors)
  - $200 â€“ Software/simulation tools
  - $150 â€“ Training resources
  - $100 â€“ Local transport/logistics
  - $200 â€“ Contingency
  - $350 â€“ Optional media production, illustrations, or freelance help

---

## 7. Stakeholders

- **Project Team**:  
  - Thomas Ware â€“ Lead Designer, Developer, Project Manager

- **Sponsors**:  
  - Self-funded; potential future support from UFV MakerSpace

- **External Parties**:  
  - YouTube audience  
  - Maker and animatronic forums (for feedback and testing)

---

## 8. Risk Management

- **Risks**:
  - Inaccurate motion timing or jitter
  - Hardware malfunctions
  - Time overruns due to scope creep
  - Compatibility issues between Obsidian and script engines

- **Mitigations**:
  - Use of high-quality servos and backups
  - Debug log validation of audio sync
  - Weekly scope check-ins
  - Version-controlled script modules

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- Servo sync verified <50ms in testing  
- 3 character configs demonstrated via modular control  
- 1 storyboard note linked to control execution  
- Public demo launched with viewer engagement (â‰¥5 comments)  
- All deliverables submitted by September 10, 2025

---

## 10. Project Governance

- **Governance Structure**:
  - Thomas Ware assumes full roles: steering, execution, QA, documentation
  - Self-imposed milestone reviews at each deliverable
  - Solo control structure with periodic community validation

---

## 11. Communication Plan

- **Internal**:
  - Daily notes and task tracking in Obsidian  
  - Weekly milestone reviews and Kanban task logs

- **External**:
  - Milestone demos via YouTube  
  - Monthly insights on LinkedIn  
  - Viewer and community feedback integration
