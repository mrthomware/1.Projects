## 🧭 Project Governance

---

### 🏛️ **Governance Structure**

#### 🔹 **Steering Committee**

* **Roles and Responsibilities**:
  Provides strategic oversight, ensures the project aligns with content goals (e.g., *BlackBook Tales*), and reviews deliverables at milestone checkpoints. Handles approvals for significant changes, resolves major conflicts, and validates timeline alignment.

* **Members**:

  * **Thomas Ware** – *Creative/Technical Director* (Sole member, solo project owner)
  * *Note*: In a future scaled version, this could include a YouTube strategist, puppetry consultant, or funding partner.

#### 🔹 **Project Manager**

* **Role and Responsibilities**:
  Acts as the lead coordinator across all project domains—design, development, integration, and documentation. Manages time, resources, deliverables, and all stakeholder communications.

* **Authority Level**:
  Full authority over technical and creative direction, milestone scheduling, tool selection, budget decisions, and task delegation (if collaborators are involved).

* **Assigned To**:
  **Thomas Ware**

  Provide resources (hardware, software, workspace), support scheduling, and approve project extensions if needed.

* **Engagement Level**:

  * Reviewed at each major milestone (July 15, Aug 1, Aug 15, Sep 1)
  * Budget reconciliation and retrospective in final review (Sep 10)

* **Current Status**:
  **Self-funded** by Thomas Ware
  *Future sponsors (e.g., UFV, maker networks) may be added if grants or support is acquired.*

#### 🔹 **External Advisors or Consultants**

* **Role and Responsibilities**:
  May assist with servo tuning, voice syncing, or design feedback during later stages. Provide expert opinion on motion realism and hardware quality.

* **Integration with Team**:
  Not currently active, but if engaged, they will be consulted through GitHub issue tracking, async video review, or limited Zoom feedback calls.

---

#### 🔹 **Quality Assurance and Compliance**

* **Roles and Responsibilities**:

  * Validate servo consistency and timing stability through logs and tests.
  * Ensure project documentation follows Obsidian conventions and internal consistency.
  * All testing and compliance conducted by Thomas Ware using in-vault quality checkpoints.

* **Review and Audit Processes**:

  * Mid-project milestone reviews.
  * Simulation testing logs.
  * YAML metadata validation for vault files.

### ⚙️ **Governance Processes**

#### 📊 **Decision-Making Process**

* All core decisions are made by the **Project Manager (Thomas Ware)**.
* Change requests (e.g., timeline shifts, feature additions) are logged in Obsidian and reviewed before implementation.
* Issues unresolved within a milestone window will be postponed to Phase 2 to protect scope.
