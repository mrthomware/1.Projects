### 1. Definition or Explanation

- **Label:** Term
    
- **Value:** Animatronics
    
- **Definition:** Animatronics refers to the use of robotic systems to emulate lifelike characteristics and movements in non-living entities, typically for entertainment or educational purposes. These systems combine mechanical, electronic, and control technologies to animate figures such as animals, humans, or fantasy creatures, often synchronized with sound and visual effects.

### 2. Use Cases or Applications

- **Theme Parks and Attractions**  
    Used extensively in amusement parks like Disney or Universal Studios, animatronics bring characters and scenes to life in rides and shows, enhancing visitor immersion.
    
- **Film and Television**  
    In special effects, animatronics serve to create realistic creatures or characters that may be too complex or expensive to render with CGI alone (e.g., dinosaurs in _Jurassic Park_).
    
- **Museum Exhibits and Education**  
    Interactive displays featuring animatronic dinosaurs or historical figures provide engaging, tactile learning experiences in science and history museums.
    
- **Retail and Advertising Displays**  
    Animated mannequins or mascots in storefronts draw attention and enhance customer engagement through motion and sound.
    
- **Military and Medical Training**  
    Realistic human-like animatronic models simulate bodily responses for hands-on training in medical procedures or battlefield scenarios.

### Glossary of Animatronics Terms

1. **Animatronics**  
    _Definition_: The use of robotic devices to emulate lifelike characteristics in puppets or models, typically for entertainment or storytelling purposes.  
    _Example_: The T. rex in _Jurassic Park_ is a famous animatronic creature, combining mechanical engineering and special effects to simulate realistic movement.
    
2. **Servo Motor**  
    _Definition_: A rotary actuator that precisely controls angular position, commonly used to drive limbs or facial expressions in animatronic figures.  
    _Example_: A servo motor may control the opening and closing of a character’s eyelids in a theme park attraction.
    
3. **Pneumatics**  
    _Definition_: A technology that uses compressed air to produce movement, often used in animatronics for actions requiring quick and forceful motion.  
    _Example_: Pneumatics are used to make a character’s arm thrust out suddenly in a haunted house prop.
    
4. **Hydraulics**  
    _Definition_: The use of pressurized liquid to create movement, offering more power than pneumatics, typically for larger animatronic systems.  
    _Example_: A life-sized dragon that breathes fire and flaps its wings might rely on hydraulics for its heavy motions.
    
5. **Control System**  
    _Definition_: The computer hardware and software that govern how an animatronic figure behaves, including movement timing and synchronization with audio.  
    _Example_: A ride's central control system triggers synchronized speech and gestures of an animatronic host character.
    
6. **Endoskeleton**  
    _Definition_: The internal structural framework of an animatronic figure that supports its motors, joints, and external coverings.  
    _Example_: The metal frame inside a humanoid robot at a theme park serves as its endoskeleton.
    
7. **Skin (Foam Latex or Silicone Skin)**  
    _Definition_: The outer layer of an animatronic, often made from foam latex or silicone to mimic human or animal textures.  
    _Example_: The soft, realistic skin of an alien character might be molded from silicone and painted for authenticity.
    
8. **Programming and Scripting**  
    _Definition_: The process of coding movement sequences and timing to choreograph animatronic behavior.  
    _Example_: A designer programs a pirate character to turn its head and laugh at set intervals during a ride sequence.
    
9. **Facial Animation**  
    _Definition_: The use of motors and mechanical linkages to control detailed facial expressions, enhancing character realism.  
    _Example_: The subtle lip movements of an animatronic singer are part of facial animation programming.
    
10. **Show Action Equipment (SAE)**  
    _Definition_: Specialized machinery and mechanisms used to create animated actions in themed entertainment settings.  
    _Example_: A trapdoor that opens to reveal a spring-loaded ghost is considered show action equipment.
